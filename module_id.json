        "description": "This course has two aims.  The first supports you in thinking, reading and writing critically about concepts found in the various disciplines of the humanities. Writings in the humanities contain abstract concepts that often turn into scientific and technological reality. It is important for you as a scholar to learn how concepts in STEM disciplines have roots that go back to the humanities. It is also relevant for you to understand how scientific and engineering innovations have objectives that promote the quality of life for all members of our human race. You will learn to identify different methodologies and approaches to texts and discuss the rhetoric and reasoning employed in these texts. You will then apply these approaches to the real world of scientific and engineering technologies and events.  The second aim is to support your communication and presentation of scientific and technical concepts to the lay public. You will learn to explain technical terms in STEM fields in language that the non-scientific public can understand. You will learn to write and present persuasively, so that the lay public will be convinced of the scientific findings and results. This is important for you as a STEM scholar, as you will be facing policy makers and politicians in your career, and you should acquire the skills and techniques of persuasion and rhetoric.",

        "name": "DECOLONISATION OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN ASIA & AFRICA",
        "description": "After the end of the Second World War, the British Empire shifted its imperialist policy due to increased economic costs to sustain its colonies and the loss of strategically important spots, such as India and Suez. The rise of the United States and the Soviet Union also led to changing balance of power. With the rise of nationalist sentiments in Asia and Africa, it became increasingly uneconomical and difficult for Britain to hold on to colonies, leading to decolonisations in the 1950s and 1960s. This module explores the political, economic, social and diplomatic factors behind the decline of the British Empire and whether the Empire was strong or weak post-1945. It also examines how patterns of decolonisation varied in British colonies in Asia and Africa. Decolonisation was executed through diverging means in different pace. For example, democratisations and decentralisations took place in Malaya and Kenya soon after the Second World War while democratic reforms were absent in Hong Kong. While British administration ceased in Singapore in 1963, Hong Kong remained a British colony until 1997. Lastly, the module investigates various means employed by the colonial governments to suppress dissidents and capture the `hearts and minds' of the locals during the transitional period, ranging from psychological tests conducted in the Malaya Emergency and secret opinion polling systems in Hong Kong, to `sanitary surveillance' in Singapore and repressive interrogation camps in Mau Mau Uprisings. In doing so, students will critically examine the relationships between the British Empire and its colonies, the Cold War and decolonisations, and culture and colonial statecrafts in Africa and Asia from 1945 to 1997.",

        "description": "This course introduces you to cutting-edge concepts, frameworks and practices that are current in social entrepreneurship, as well as critical issues in business ethics as a knowledge foundation for analysing and practicing social entrepreneurship. The course considers how social entrepreneurship plays out in organizations ranging from conventional companies seeking to adopt corporate social responsibility practices to double-bottom-line businesses and social enterprises. The course specifies strategic and implementation tensions inherent in aligning business and social/environmental values, and provides frameworks with which to analyse and resolve the tensions at play.This course trains you into a quasi-expert of social entrepreneurship by enabling them to apply frameworks to making tough decisions in real business contexts. The course includes four modules: strategic corporate social responsibility (SCSR); double-bottom-line business (DBL), social enterprise (SE) and business ethics (BE). It begins by analysing and making decisions on the cases of conventional companies conducting social innovation initiatives through SCSR and DBL. We will then move to explore the cases of social enterprises. You will observe both the common and distinctive challenges facing conventional companies and social enterprises. The modules of SCSR, DBL and SE will be followed by an Entrepreneur Panel where social entrepreneurs introduce their initiatives and engage in a highly interactive conversation with students. The course will finish by taking a look at business ethics theories and issues that provide analytical depth and clarification to your understanding of social entrepreneurship.",

        "description": "As a sports coach helps an athlete develop and excel at a sport, a health coach helps a person or team to excel at living healthy life to the full, taking the best. This course will equip you with foundations of health coaching - skills useful for life wherever it takes you - whether you will be the next CEO, a full-time dad or mom, an entrepreneur or a cool government employee. It comprises a series of modules covering highly engaging topics on health coaching with a focus on sleep as a superpower. This is the first course in a stackable learning series that would equip you ultimately as a super health coach. The course consists of 13 three-hour sessions (two sessions of 3 hours per week) comprising of blended and highly interactive learning activities, conducted in the first six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22. The last session will be an assessment session held in the sixth week. In addition, this same course will also be run in the last six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22, and an assessment session to be held in the sixth week. These sessions will cover the following seven themes: 1.\tBeing cool! Being super-woman and -man (introduction to health coaching) 2.\tWho cares about sleep? Superpower. (sleep) 3.\tThis is so tasty! (nutrition) 4.\tSweat the good stuff (exercise) 5.\tWhy? Why? It's driving me crazy! (mental wellbeing) 6.\tIs it gonna harm me? (addictions) 7.\tRelationships matter! (healthy relationships) The modules cover the topic of sleep, but also important areas that affect sleep such as nutrition, exercise, mental wellbeing, addictions, and healthy relationships. These modules will be offered in a `flipped classroom model' where students self-study materials and subsequently have discussions and practical interactive sessions. The students will practice coaching skills which will be assessed in a role-based assessment with simulated roles. The cutting-edge role of digital health supporting the coach and the person will be interwoven in every module. Finally, we Singaporeans are one of the most sleep deprived people. Some might even be proud about regularly not sleeping enough. However, this comes at a high price for wellbeing and health. Utilizing the superpower of sleep has a wide range of proven health benefits including a lower chance of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, and not least making one feel better! Recognizing that one can be cool whilst living healthy and shunning away from unhealthy lifestyle habits and applying early preventive measures to improve health is possible and is focus of this course. An important strategy to facilitate healthy lifestyle choices and promote health is through health coaching. Health coaching has been applied and shown to be effective in the prevention and management of chronic diseases and supporting lifestyle choices in healthy individuals. It is crucial to equip students with healthy lifestyle skills and knowledge and, specifically, on coaching techniques to create awareness about the importance of lifestyle choices. It will allow students to be equipped with essential skills to become health coaches and to take the role of health ambassadors later in their life. Moreover, health coaching can provide new career opportunities, with employment in healthcare expected to increase enormously in the coming years. This course will be the first in a series of courses on health coaching, with the current course having a focus on sleep. Sleep is crucial for health and wellbeing, and it is known that many students do not get enough sleep However, sleep deprivation is linked to lower cognitive and academic performance, lower productivity, obesity, depression, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, and numerous other health risk factors. Exercise, nutrition, and mental wellbeing all have an important influence on a healthy sleep pattern. A `stackable learning approach' is planned in which students will be able to `stack' certificates that will eventually lead to a professional diploma as health coach.",

While films are generally seen as a leisure activity, the cinema cannot be divorced from society and the pressing issues of our times. It can function as a forum in which viewers are not only entertained but informed and educated and cognitively prepared to develop good citizenship. The audience is presented with topics and issues of great concern in the community, which are often controversial, and certainly provocative. This module seeks to stimulate and inspire students towards a more critical view of cinema as a medium that challenges viewing practices and cognitive senses through the content of the films. Students will be taught to understand the cinema as a medium of social communication, presenting stories that question our views of society and politics.  The module will familiarize students with a range of cinematic works, key readings and important trends in contemporary global cinema and, secondly, to develop critical tools and skills in analyzing contemporary films with respect to both their aesthetic properties and their various historical, social, political determinants.",

Here, the principles established in CE1005/CZ1005/SC1005-Digital Logic will be extended to encompass circuits of greater complexity.  These circuits are no longer implemented using multiple discrete logic elements, as presented in CE1005/CZ1005/SC1005, but rather use Application Specific Gate Array (ASIC) or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technologies. Both of these technologies can accommodate circuits of complexity equivalent to many millions of gates. This course will focus on FPGA technology as it is gaining commercial popularity (due to the cost of ASIC Implementations). The necessary logic and connectivity for both technologies is synthesised by software tools from code written in a Hardware Description Language. As such, this course presents you with circuit design techniques for more advanced systems in a methodical manner based on modern design techniques.",

The course begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to elements, starting with agriculture (-land-) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals, particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at the end of the course.",

We want students to establish an object-oriented mindset and to gain valuable insights into how software can be developed using the object-oriented approach. This course should not be interpreted to be a pure programming language course. Rather, the programming language serves to illustrate, via practical examples, the concepts learnt in the course. As a student of this course, you will learn essential object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, the separation of design from implementation; the use of inheritance and polymorphism. You will discover how to describe these concepts using appropriate UML diagrams. Finally, you will also learn good design principles for reuse, and to realise these principles using object-oriented programming languages such as Java and/or C++.",

The aim of this course is to deepen the understanding of behaviors in the market by further examining the decision process of economic agents and the implied welfare consequences.  In the first half of the course, we focus on how individuals make their decisions in the market by discussing two broad topics. The first is the analysis of price and income changes in the market. This discussion builds on what have already been covered in Principals of Microeconomics. The second topic is individual decision-making regarding time, risk, and uncertainty where we will also examine how the asset market works.  In the second half of the course, we focus on analysing the welfare effects of outcomes in markets and society. To this end, students will learn different measures of welfare and criteria for efficiency, and how perfectly competitive markets help achieve socially optimal outcomes. Subsequently, we will discuss the problems related to making choices for society and how these may be reconciled.",

These include utilitarianism, Kantian duty ethics and the ideas of the virtue and natural law ethical tradition stemming from Aristotle and Aquinas. A brief overview of theories of justice (including those of Rawls, Nozick and Sen) will be made. And it is intended that these concepts will be critically applied to the interface between ethics and law and the market, and some of paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, in a series of case studies under the headings: Profit, People, Planet.  Intended Audience: It is a participation intensive course for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. These may include: corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and labour rights (people), and environmental sustainability (planet).

This is a stunning, and perhaps alarming, claim. It's all the more stunning once we recognize that this power is wielded, not merely over non- human animals or children, but over competent adults. Accordingly, the fundamental question of contemporary political philosophy is this: How is authority - i.e., the power to create moral obligations in others by means of commands -possible among free and equal moral persons? Anarchists think this question does not admit of a plausible answer. In this class, we'll see if they're right.  In this course, you will learn about various theories of the moral justification of state power.  You will critically evaluate arguments for and against these theories.

The course begins by looking at DNA as the carrier of genetic information and how the genetic code is used to produce proteins which carry out most of the reactions in the cell. You will be introduced to restriction enzymes and ligase ? the cornerstones of recombinant methodology. We will also explore how the cell is organized into compartments, how proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm are targeted to the various compartments, how the cell maintains its shape and size through the cytoskeleton, how cell moves and how the cell divides to produce daughter cells. Key experiments and researchers? contributions will be highlighted to inspire students. Tutorials will be used to clarify doubts and strengthen understanding.",

Through reading the contributions of contemporary theorists such as Alain Badiou, Jacques Ranciere, William Connolly, Davide Panagia, Joshua Foa Dienstag, Michael Shapiro, and others, we will investigate such diverse topics as film's relation to democratic thinking, the connection between cinematic and political representation, the political economy of film production, and film's embodiment of thinking the event. In addition, we will also examine a select group of particular film genres - specifically the Western, the horror, and the film noir - in order to understand what particular insights they communicate about contemporary political life.",

In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic \"Age of Faith\" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages.

In fact, the existence of living beings in this planet depends on the ability of thousands of proteins to work together in a seamless fashion. Furthermore, our ability to comprehend our surroundings is heavily influenced by the activity of billions of neurons in our brain. Such complex systems can be represented as static or dynamic networks of many interacting components. These components are typically much simpler in terms of behavior or function than the overall system, implying that the additional complexity of the latter is an emergent network property. Network science is a new discipline that investigates the topology and dynamics of such complex networks, aiming to better understand the behavior, function and properties of the underlying systems. In this course, we will study algorithmic, computational, and statistical methods of network science, as well as its applications in solving real-world problems in communications, biology, sociology, and cyber security. The specific topics include network metrics, properties, and models, network querying and analytics, network dynamics, and distributed graph engines. Another pervasive goal of this course is to guide students into the future by presenting research that reveals the ?next big thing? in network science.",

        "description": "This module explores the diplomatic, political, social and economic history of British Hong Kong during the period from 1945 to 1997. It examines how development in China and decolonization of the British Empire influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony.  Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between colonial Hong Kong, Britain and China via six inter-locking themes: imperial diplomacy, diplomatic end game, social order and colonial state-building, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of Hong Kong during the colonial era, useful insights in China's development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired.",

There was no Absurdist movement, and most playwrights whom we consider Absurdists did not identify themselves as such. Nevertheless, the designation is useful to begin thinking about their\tshared concern for what it means to be human in a time of social and political upheaval. You will be provoked to consider this central question as you learn more about the playwrights' dramatizations of habit, time, humour and suffering. The course will train you to close read Absurdist plays, and develop an appreciation for theirI destabilising effects on actors and the audience member. By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to differentiate between the social, historical,philosophical factors that affect the writing and production of absurdist drama. The seminar format will facilitate discussions as\t you share your reading, viewing, and performance/staging experiences with the class.  Course Content The discomfort and frustration evoked by the Theatre of the Absurd force character(s) and the audience to confront the question, \"What does it mean to be human?\" Each week, we will look\tclosely at one play, and if a recording of a production is available, we will view snippets in class to give you an idea of how each play could be staged. You will also perform scenes from the play in\t1, class.

        "description": "Effective decision making is an essential skill everyone should have. Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions.",

        "description": "Employment Law is critical to managing human capital. This course focuses on the employment law in Singapore as a foundation for an understanding of the employment relationship and its incidents. The course examines how the law determines the employment relationship from a contract for service (associated with independent contractors) as the cornerstone of the employment relationship. The rights and obligations of the parties are examined not only at the contractual level, but also from the wider perspective of the common law, statutory framework (where applicable) and other sources of law which impinge on the employment relationship. The course also examines how and when the employment relationship comes to an end - by proper termination, summary dismissal, frustration, threat of harm, etc and highlights claims for wrongful and unfair dismissal, and other remedies available to both the employer and the employee.  Besides a sound working grasp of the basic legal principles, the course is also intended to provide perspectives, theoretical and practical, from which to critically assess the possible solutions and the law's responses to vital problems commonly encountered both in Singapore and abroad. Selected topics are given a comparative international treatment.",

Political parties, in the West at least, have contributed enormously to the flourishing and stability of democracy. Parties link the state and society, take part in elections and contribute towards the structuring (and re-structuring) of political processes and institutions. Yet, the nature of political parties differ throughout time and space; similarly, the nature of elections differ throughout democracies - there is significant diversity in the way the electoral systems are structured, the legislations governing elections, the frequency of elections, the way campaigns are conducted, inter alia. As such, there is a need to understand the differing types of parties and elections, the impact that they have on society and political systems, who runs in elections, how voters make their choices, and the threats to our existing understandings of democracy and elections. This module studies the development of political parties and electoral systems, emphasizing the analytical component (how and why) in addition to the standard descriptive approach (what).",

        "name": "MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY",
        "description": "With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success.  Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global.  Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts.  This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts.  No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development of skills for dealing with complex problems in general.",

This course is designed to prepare the candidate to evaluate the strategies needed to face these challenges. This course also looks at the potential liability and the prevention of the misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis, interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with brands - embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works.  This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in Intellectual Property law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property.  The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication - or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy.

Starting with Peirce and Frege, mathematicians and philosophers developed logical systems that were much more powerful than the traditional logical systems inherited from thinkers such as Aristotle. It became clear that by using these new tools, it was possible to formalize large swaths of mathematics, and many mathematicians and philosophers started to think that it may even be possible to reduce mathematics to formal logic. However, in the wake of this optimism, a number of results were proven that demonstrated several fundamental limitations inherent in our best formal logical systems. This class introduces students to the major positive results - including the soundness and completeness theorems of first-order logic - and the major limitation results, in particular Godel's incompleteness theorems and Church's undecidability theorem. The philosophical implications of the results will be emphasized.",

        "description": "This course will provide students/student teachers with an in-depth understanding of the instructive power of well-designed learning environments. The learning environment has been espoused as the `third educator', a concept which is strongly rooted in early childhood education. Participants will gain insights into how the learning environments can provide stimulating and engaging activities that promote quality learning for the children across all learning domains.  In order to be equipped with the essential knowledge and skills to design effective environments, they will learn how to consider the needs of diverse children (individual and group), the relevance of the learning contexts, the use of age-appropriate and open-ended resources, issues of safety (physical and psychological), and the interlocking roles of the teacher as the environmental designer and as the facilitator of the learning in the setting up of the environment. To highlight the importance of exploration and play-based learning, and authentic experiences for preschool or lower primary children, the employment of learning centres will be extensively explored as an important pedagogical approach for teachers in the preschool or lower primary specialization. A key idea here is that the learning environment can support children as the protagonists of their construction of knowledge and foster respectful relationships. The course will therefore provide participants with an understanding of the principles and roles of learning centers and how these can be thoughtfully integrated within the preschool or lower primary curriculum and class setups (indoor and outdoor). The course will have a strong practical orientation. There will be opportunities for participants to link theory to practice through hands-on activities and assignments. Where possible, field trips will also be organized to expose participants to actual environmental setups as part of their learning experiences.  We recommend that students who wish to pursue an EC minor complete AED16A and AED16D first because these two courses can greatly support you with AED16B, AED16C and AED16E.",

Neuromarketing involves capturing consumers' subconscious responses to brands, products and marketing materials in order to predict their purchasing behaviour more accurately than traditional market research methods (e.g. focus groups and surveys which are confounded by the fact that many times people either don't tell the truth about what they think or they don't know how they feel). The approach is now widely used by multinational companies to develop superior products that will also succeed in a global marketplace. The course will delve into the range of different neuromarketing techniques that are currently available (e.g. eyetracking while people use websites to see what they are attending to, monitoring brain activity while they viewing adverts or new product ideas to measure their emotions etc) and discuss the pros and cons of the different methods. Case studies will be used to demonstrate how the different approaches are being used by companies to tackle a very wide range of marketing questions. Students will also learn how insights from the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience can be applied in order to make marketing messages and communications more attention grabbing, more memorable and emotionally engaging. Also covered will be emerging research showing how digital technology is re-wiring the human brain and changing our behaviour in subtle ways but which marketers need to understand in order to create campaigns and messages that will be effective in today's digital environment.

Students will hone their skills for critiquing research and learn the basics of designing, conducting and reporting on their own sociological investigations. The course will prepare students for the Graduation Project.  The course is divided into four sections. In the first, we address certain basic questions in sociological research: how do we think about the connections between theory and empirical data? What do sociologists study and how? What are the differences between qualitative and quantitative research? We will also tackle the many ethical and practical issues that come about in sociologists? generation and use of qualitative data.  In the second section of the semester, students learn more about two of the most important approaches in qualitative sociological research: participant observation (also known as ethnography) and in-depth interviews. You will read examples of these methods as well as learn the techniques for conducting such research.  Third, we will discuss how to organize and interpret data, and how to effectively use data in theory-building and in our writings. We will examine once again the connections between theory and evidence, and thereby further discuss what makes for good sociological questions and how to design good research to address issues that sociologists and the general public care about.  Finally, we will briefly discuss textual and content analyses. We will also learn how to craft effective research proposals",

Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.  While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts.

        "description": "The role of immersive media: The experience of being immersed by enticing 360degree audio-visuals brings your audience one step closer to the reproduction of reality, or at least a believable representation of another time and space. Creating immersive 360degree experiences is both a technical and artistic challenge, but highly rewarding. The course will introduce you to the basic concepts of immersive media and will deliver a practice-based introduction to the fundamental techniques and processes involved in producing and presenting 360degree experiences.  Image acquisition and post-production: Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn essential and advanced image acquisition techniques and post-production workflows required for immersive media.  Viewing experiences: By analysing a variety of examples, you will be able to identify the strength and weaknesses in 360degree imagery, to refine your own assessments.  Beyond traditional narrativity: You will explore storytelling and narrative considerations for immersive environments that deviate from traditional formats.  Artistic considerations: What makes a good composition for an environment in which you cannot define your frame? How can you direct your audience to stay focussed or look around? Which role do audio and other senses play? Through analysis of a variety of examples, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating successful immersive experiences.  Class assignments: Creative projects, which explore concept-development, fundamental image acquisition and editing techniques, as well as story-formats for immersive media. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.",

        "description": "Cyber physical systems are typically designed as a network of interacting elements with physical input and output, and are characterized by the interaction between the physical world (sensors, user inputs, actuators) and the cyber world (processing, decision making). Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards. In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.",

        "description": "Communication with the market is an important activity for many businesses and organizations. It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.  The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives.  The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities.  Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.",

These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics.

In particular: to what ends should citizens? behavior be guided, and by which means should a government guide such behavior? When might a public policy intervention by the government in the affairs of private individuals be unethical? Ethics and Public Policy will survey a number of areas in which public policy has been used to address social and political issues: crime, immigration, health, safety, inequality, religion, and the family. Students will question, debate, and reflect on the ethical principles which favor or disfavor the implementation of various public policies.",

        "name": "THE MEAT OF SPEECH",
        "description": "The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.  The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.  The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)  will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.  The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.  The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.  The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.  Key subjects covered include: 1.\tusing  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of speech production and perception; 2.\tthe relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms of speech production; 3.\tan  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function; 4.\tan appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing; 5.\tpractice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data.",

        "description": "Urbanization continues apace into the 21st Century worldwide, centering cities and metropolitan regions as critical units of politics and policy-making in issues including immigration, housing and climate c'hange. As large, dense and diverse human habitats, urban politics and policy-making are influenced by the dynamic triadic relationship among society, economy and land. In cities, land use allocation and production of space interact with the needs of diverse populations, capital and municipal institutions to generate contested spatial claims among multiple stakeholders. The size of its diversity and concentration of diversity also make cities places of subcultures, varied institutions and fragmented interests. As gateways for new ideas and adoption of new cultures, cities are also sites of dynamic social and spatial change that function as multi-scalar hubs of interconnections among the neighborhood, city, metropolitan and national levels.  By 2030, Asia will emerge as the region with the most cities and with more big cities than anywhere else in the world, according to United Nations (2018). It should be expected that the 'local turn' in politics and policy-making experienced in American and European cities over the last two decades will continue, and Asian cities will follow suit, albeit differently due to their different political regimes.  The course aims are twofold:  Firstly, the course offers knowledge about the particularities of the urban environment for politics about space/place and policy-making, and an ongoing tension between people-based and place-based policies. This course draws upon multi-disciplinary knowledge in urban planning, sociology, geography, public policy and public administration to inform our understanding of urban politics and policy-making - essentially interdisciplinary areas of knowledge creation.  Secondly, the course seeks to equip you with a set of skills to research and analyze questions related to policies that govern the functions, problems and life of a city.

The course combines close reading with contextual analysis, giving students the opportunity to develop their understanding of poetic forms and devices while exploring works in their aesthetic, cultural, and political milieu. It also draws together current research in the fields of Romantic studies and poetics with literary criticism published during the period, by writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Throughout the semester, students will consider how poems on the syllabus were experienced by Romantic audiences, using the William Blake Archive to access high-resolution reproductions of Blake's illuminated books and the Princeton Prosody Archive to access late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century guidelines for reading poetry aloud.",

Worse, the information might be inaccurate or incomplete. When people make decisions based on 'bad' information, the results can be far from ideal.  Media literacy is a competency to use media tools, both as a content creator and information consumer. The latter competency is important for society because it affects how people respond to ideas they encounter in the media. Misinformation, fake news, and rumours are examples of the kinds of 'bad' information people may receive.  There are several questions pertinent to media literacy: How far does 'bad' information pervade the media? How media-literate is the average information consumer? What factors contribute to or hinder media literacy? Can media literacy be taught? This course provides some answers to these questions and addresses the broad question, what is the role of media literacy in society?  This course is meant for all students who have an interest in media, whether that interest aligns with career aspirations or personal curiosity. Although you may further develop your own media literacy skills through this course, this course is not about how you can become more media literate. It is about why people everywhere need media literacy. In other words, you may gain perspective on your own media use, but the focus of your learning will lead to new insights about media literacy and society.",

We will review current evidence about the influence of different linguistic features on different domains of cognition and perception (e.g., categorization, spatial cognition, numerical cognition, colour perception, audition, and cross-modal perception). For each domain, we will investigate how the published literature relates to language in Singapore, and identify gaps in the existing literature. Interactions between language and the mind in extreme scenarios (e.g., language deprivation) will also be addressed.

Once a cultural backwater, the intensive export of South Korean products has changed the flow of the transnational circulation of popular media and culture not just East and Southeast Asia, but the larger world. Making up for its geo-political marginality is its newfound soft power status when countless households from Japan to Latin America are watching its television dramas and where teenagers from Singapore to Canada line up for Kpop auditions to be the next Korean popular music sensation.  Accompanying the Korean Wave, or Hallyu are the heightened popular and scholarly discussions of the attributes of this phenomenon. A combination factors have been put forward to explain the rise of the Korean Wave including the release in creative energies arising from political liberalization in the 1990s, technological advancement particular in the era of the digital and social media, and significant investment and sophisticated marketing. In this respect, as a course, the Korean Wave will offer a potentially multidisciplinary engagement with students, many who are already avid fans of Hallyu products and icons.",

Yet a significant number of organisations reported high failure rate in driving change initiatives. While employees are told that 'the only constant is change', they often do not get much positive experience when supporting organizational change efforts. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences. This is because change occurs at multiple levels, from individual's mindset change to group, and even organization. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation. Business leaders, together with their Human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations.

Subjects are examined through a conceptual lens: studying different aspects of semantics, imagery, perception, behaviour, beliefs, culture as structural frameworks in the development of ideas. Output includes, but is not limited to conceptual objects, user interactions, anthropomorphic interfaces, event/service situations, environmental installations, temporal experiments etc. Teaching in this studio course is by lecture, presentations, projects and assignments.  Conceptual Design Framework in the Creative Process: The course begins with an introduction on the importance of placing ideas into a context that is driven not just by its form and function as the design genesis but instead through a tangent that looks at the design process conceptually prior to the practice of design ? a pre-theoretical approach to design by looking at why and how the creative process operates. Content here will critically examine of the design process itself, looking at the methodology designers take for granted in their creative and production activity.  Design as Discourse/ Critical Design: You will be introduced to the practice of critical design and its variants - such as speculative design and discursive design, and how they serve as powerful tools for discourse about the design of the world. These `tools of design? are critiqued and explored through the use of language, imagery, fantasy, connotations, metaphors, semantics in the conception and development of students? projects.

This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning.  We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints.

The hallmark of those aging-associated diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, is protein aggregation that occurs when protein homeostasis collapses. Cellular protein homeostasis is maintained by regulating protein synthesis, folding and degradation. Therefore, this course will address the whole life cycle of proteins and you will learn how failure of each step of the cycle is linked with neurodegenerative diseases. Various genes and pathways involved in aging are also an important topic of the course. This course will help you understand why debilitating neurodegenerative diseases are on the increase in our society and how to approach to cure them.",

Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion.  The Digital Workflow: Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. What Makes a Good Photograph? An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed.  Developing a Photographic Series: An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images.  The Role of the Photographer: Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph.  Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography.  Class Assignments: - Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography.  - To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.  - In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.",

        "description": "In order to sell a product, one must tell a story: one that engages the customer on a deeply emotional level. This is vital to modern branding, defining your company ethos and building long-term customer relationships. This course concentrates on visual storytelling for cinema, television and multi-media.  Story depends on solid structuring and the ability to utilise storytelling to awaken the imagination of the buyer, but first and foremost it is about emotion: generating the right degree of emotion and aligning that to company and product branding for given visual media. We therefore need to understand psychology and have real insight into people, not just as a persuasive tool, but a genuine understanding of what people's deepest desires are and how your brand delivers that desire. Having understood the tones, attitudes and empathy generated by your product, we must then structure well. There are two concepts we need to understand to convey this: striking the note of simplicity to engage the emotions and secondly basing those stories on timeless myths and storytelling principles.  Having instilled all this, we must then question the nature of advertising as a metacognitive process for the designer of commercials. This provides perspectives on the story being told and why we are compelled to tell it well. By viewing advertising examples from cinema, television and multi-media and investigating the myths and principles that underpin their success, this course reaches deep into the creativity of the student to grow beyond outmoded forms of selling and embrace the future of visual sales-personship.  The course therefore generates competency in storytelling for practitioners and researchers in the field of effective advertising. Enrollment is suited to advertising students, advertising industry practitioners, journalists, communications students as well as film, television and transmedia practitioners.",

The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.",

        "description": "The above figure depicts the Moller Franz illusion. The lengths of the three lateral lines above appear to be different, although they are of the same length. The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include:  1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains?  2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now.  3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.  All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies.",

Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.  Node-Based Compositing: In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.  Compositing Techniques: Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.  Artistic Considerations: What makes a good composite?

        "description": "Cyber physical systems are typically designed as a network of interacting elements with physical input and output, and are characterized by the interaction between the physical world (sensors, user inputs, actuators) and the cyber world (processing, decision making). Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards. In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.",

        "description": "This course is an introduction to mathematical finance. The course serves to equip students with basic mathematical knowledge and computational skills needed to solve problems related to finance. Furthermore, this course lays the foundation for more advanced topics, such as econometrics, stochastic calculus and optimal control theory, which make finance a very exciting subject. Modern finance draws upon many fields of mathematics, in particular, algebra, econometrics, numerical analysis, optimization theory, partial differential equations, probability theory, statistics and stochastic calculus. The diversity of mathematical skills needed to master finance makes it a very challenging subject for students. The mathematical topics covered in this course include matrix algebra, calculus, difference equation, differential equation, optimization and portfolio mathematics (please refer to the proposed seminar schedule for details). The topics in the first five weeks of the course introduce students to the simplest financial market model and explain arbitrage pricing in a discrete time framework. The topics in the next three weeks lay the foundations for continuous time finance. The topics in the last four weeks introduce students to optimization and portfolio theory. These selected topics serve as an introduction to some of the fields of mathematics that modern finance draws upon.",

        "description": "Students will learn a brief history of expressive style in drawing and will learn about current drawing practices in contemporary art. Through a self-guided library search they will find and explore and investigate the work of artists who use expressive drawing. This investigation will help students to develop and enhance their studio art-making experience and deepen their understanding of the role of drawing in human development and in art. Students will learn a variety of traditional and frequently used drawing techniques and materials used in past and current artworks. They will also decide upon and experiment with the use of alternative drawing materials. In consultation with the lecturer, students will decide to create either six small finished drawings or two larger finished drawings with accompanying preparation drawings, technique/material experiments and other evidence of their working process. The final artworks must utilize materials introduced at the beginning of the course and may incorporate alternative materials. Through the development and making process students will acquire working methods, research skills and technical knowledge necessary to successfully realize their own uniquely expressive drawings. They will also develop an understanding of the importance of drawing in history and an awareness of its relevance in contemporary art issues.  Attendance is a requirement as there are continual and formative assessments.",

Supply chain analytics is a set of approaches utilized to efficiently integrate suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses and stores and to efficiently manage material, information and financial flows so that merchandise is produced and distributed at the right quantities, to the right locations, and at the right time, in order to maximize system-wide surplus or value. It plays an important role in today's global economy, because efficient supply chains not only make companies more profitable but also allow customers to receive better products at lower prices. For business and technology management students, it becomes critical to have a good understanding of supply chains and its vital role as a source of both performance improvement and business innovation.

In this era of big data, many companies and public organizations invest heavily in various flavors of analytics: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. Among them, prescriptive analytics goes beyond what happened (descriptive analytics), what will happen (predictive analytics), and provides insights into what to do to help companies and public organizations make better decisions.
This course aims to introduce students to the theory and applications of prescriptive analytics: how to go from data to optimal decision-making. It contains two principal components (1) Data-driven optimization theories and techniques and (2) Important business applications in finance, investment, and operations management.
Optimization theories such as linear optimization, discrete optimization, network optimization, quadratic optimization, stochastic optimization, and robust optimization will be covered in this course, with applications in portfolio selection, asset allocation, risk management, revenue management, pricing and hedging of options, asset/liability management, appointment scheduling, retail operations, inventory management, and assets repositioning in a sharing economy.
We will also place a specific focus on analyzing real data and solving optimization models using Python with commercial solver Gurobi*.

* Academic version is free.

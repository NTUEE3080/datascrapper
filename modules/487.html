The course will examine the intellectual history of the study of communication (i.e., the evolution of ideas related to the field), and for the most part take a biographical approach to understanding the development of the discipline.  We will review the life and times, as well as the thinking, of some of the forerunners and founders of the field of communication, highlighting important theoretical developments along the way, and identifying major themes, concepts, and ideas.  The focus will be on the intellectual, institutional, and socio-political influences that helped to foster the emergence and shape the growth of the communication discipline in the twentieth century.

This course introduces basic principles and methods of social scientific research. These skills are required for marketing, public relations, and communication campaigns based on research, and for measuring campaign effectiveness. Regardless of your career path, these skills are increasingly essential for us as citizens and consumers, to understand public discourse and policy debates that draw on the findings of research studies.

Conducting research is critical for some career paths in communication, marketing, and public relations, and for those who pursue further graduate study or academic careers in research.

Though many of the examples will be of communication research, much of the material is applicable to all social and behavioral sciences, and even physical and mathematical sciences.
The lectures will present the critical content for the course, and the tutorials are designed to allow for reflection and application of the key concepts. While there will be opportunities for discussion during lecture, the tutorials are where most of the in-person dialogue will occur. An online discussion forum is also available for students to pose questions and share ideas related to the course.

In Korean Cinema in the Global Context you will explore the history and theory of Korean cinema
- both South and North through the framework of national/transnational cinema discourse, auteur/genre theory, globalization, the North/South division system, and the problem of nation/state which evokes the question of identity. In this chronologically structured module, you will learn the cinema of Korea through a set of key films, directors, and dominant genres by lectures, screenings, and intensive and engaging discussions throughout the semester. Such critically and historically important films as The Aimless Bullet, The Housemaid, Shiri, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, My Sassy Girl, The Host, and Train to Busan will be screened. Through readings, discussions, in-class screenings, and presentations, our goal is to develop a broad understanding of Korean cinema and popular cultures exploring their wide-ranging impact and asking how they participate in the transnational production and circulation of culture, ideology, modernity, politics, and tradition in both regional and international contexts. It is not necessary for student to have prior knowledge of Korean cinema, and all are welcome.

We are all media users and whether we are conscious about it or not, the media we use affect us. We need to understand what we do with the media as well as what the media can do to us. That's part of media literacy. But as mass communicators, we also need to understand how what we do affects others. That's part of being responsible. Thankfully, 'media effects' is a rich and popular area of mass communication research. In this class, we will be studying old and new research on how the media shape our experience and existence.

This course covers the principles and techniques of data mining for extracting information from large amounts of numerical data. The information mined from data is often in the form of associations, patterns or specific facts, that can be synthesized to create new knowledge, construct prediction models or used in decision making. The class will be run partly in a project-based/problem-based style. Lab sessions and the class project will provide students with hands-on experience with a data mining software. The approach taken in the course is a how-to-do-it, how-does-it-work and how-to-apply-it kind of approach, to develop the student's common sense ability to manipulate and analyze data intelligently for deriving new knowledge or supporting decision making.

This course aims to introduce you to the martial arts cinemas of Asia. You will study classical and contemporary films produced by East Asian cinemas (China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea), allowing you to become acquainted with the historical, institutional and cultural contexts behind these films. You will be introduced to a wide variety of Asian cinematic styles and they will learn the richness and diversity of regional film cultures as well as the respective societies of the countries featured. Due to the wide range of films and countries covered in this course, you are encouraged to view each lecture as a critical introduction to pertinent critical issues within each national cinema rather than a comprehensive overview of each film culture. Therefore, you are expected to use the various lectures as starting points for more in-depth research on particular films and national cultures. 
This course introduces a range of Asian cinemas and specific films in the genre of martial arts cinema to foster awareness and intercultural communication.
1.	Generic analysis of films from the prism of intercultural awareness
2.	Application of knowledge through discussions and tests of study cases

This course is designed to introduce you to significant concepts and issues in planning for, and evaluating communication campaigns. There are two primary objectives of this course: 1) to provide you with knowledge and skills for conducting communication campaign research and 2) to guide you in building critical literacies to constructively criticize the campaign evaluations of others. These are skills that are actively sought after by professional campaigns, industry leaders, and government agencies across a wide range of contexts.

This course is centered on one grand question, 'How can we demonstrate that a communication campaign is effective?' While this question seems simple at first, you will learn that there is a great deal of breadth and depth of reasoning and observation needed in fully answering this question.

This is a module for advanced students addressing the question, 'How does film relate to society and politics?' It focuses on the medium itself and on the nature of the medium as it relates to both political and documentary subjects. The module therefore is designed to show and teach students the double aspects of film, firstly, to reflect reality and, secondly, to tackle political topics with highly contentious subjective techniques. While films are generally seen as a leisure activity, the cinema cannot be divorced from society and the pressing issues of our times. It can function as a forum in which viewers are not only entertained but informed and educated and cognitively prepared to develop good citizenship. The audience is presented with topics and issues of great concern in the community, which are often controversial, and certainly provocative. This module seeks to stimulate and inspire students towards a more critical view of cinema as a medium that challenges viewing practices and cognitive senses through the content of the films. Students will be taught to understand the cinema as a medium of social communication, presenting stories that question our views of society and politics. 

The module will familiarize students with a range of cinematic works, key readings and important trends in contemporary global cinema and, secondly, to develop critical tools and skills in analyzing contemporary films with respect to both their aesthetic properties and their various historical, social, political determinants.

From Samsung Galaxy Notes to Gangnam Style dances, since the late 1990s, Korean popular entertainment and products have been making substantial regional and international headways. Once a cultural backwater, the intensive export of South Korean products has changed the flow of the transnational circulation of popular media and culture not just East and Southeast Asia, but the larger world. Making up for its geo-political marginality is its newfound soft power status when countless households from Japan to Latin America are watching its television dramas and where teenagers from Singapore to Canada line up for Kpop auditions to be the next Korean popular music sensation.   

Accompanying the Korean Wave, or Hallyu are the heightened popular and scholarly discussions of the attributes of this phenomenon. A combination factors have been put forward to explain the rise of the Korean Wave including the release in creative energies arising from political liberalization in the 1990s, technological advancement particular in the era of the digital and social media, and significant investment and sophisticated marketing. In this respect, as a course, the Korean Wave will offer a potentially multidisciplinary engagement with students, many who are already avid fans of Hallyu products and icons.

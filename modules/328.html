In today's era of Information, `Data' is the new driving force, provided we know how to extract relevant `Intelligence'. This course will start with the core principles of Data Science, and will equip you with the basic tool and techniques of data handling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data-based inference, and data-focussed communication. The course will also introduce you to the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence - state space representation, uninformed search, and reinforcement learning. 
The course will motivate you to work closely with data and make data-driven decisions in your field of study. The course will also touch upon ethical issues in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and motivate you to explore the cutting-edge applications related to Big Data, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Python will be the language of choice to introduce hands-on computational techniques.

The first four topics of the text are devoted to the analysis of the stresses and of the corresponding deformations in various structural members, considering successively axial loading, torsion, and pure bending. Each analysis is based on a few basic concepts, namely, the conditions of equilibrium of the forces exerted on the member, the relations existing between stress and strain in the material, and the conditions imposed by the supports and loading of the member. The study of each type of loading is complemented by a large number of examples designed to strengthen the students' understanding of the subject.

Topic 5 is devoted to the determination of shearing stresses in beams under transverse loadings. More advanced aspects of the design of beams, such as the determination of the principal stresses at the junction of the flange and web of a W-beam, are in Topic 6. The chapter also includes the determination of stresses under combined loadings that can now include the determination of the principal stresses, principal planes, and maximum shearing stress at a given point.
The determination of the deflection of beams is discussed in Topic 7. The first part of the chapter is devoted to the integration method followed by the use of singularity functions. 

Topic 8 is devoted to columns and includes the design of steel and aluminum columns.

This course will emphasize on the fundamentals of materials science and engineering that are related to various types of aerospace materials and the understanding on the processing-microstructure-property relation of these materials. This course will pay particular attention to the issues of why different materials are used for different parts of the aircrafts, their manufacturing processes and what are the challenges involved, why these materials fail and how to avoid their failures, as well as how to enhance the performance of these materials for better performance of the aircrafts. In order to understand these topics, fundamental knowledge related to microstructures and their formation as a result of processing history, strengthening mechanisms and related basic knowledge, various failure modes, and various manufacturing processes (casting, machining, forming and joining) including their salient features and limitations will be studied.

A comprehensive knowledge of heat transfer is essential to the training of a mechanical engineer in our knowledge-based economy.  As a first course on the subject, it covers the essential topics of heat transfer viz. one-dimensional, steady and unsteady heat conduction, extended surface heat transfer, convection fundamentals and applications, principles and methods of heat exchanger rating and design and radiation heat transfer analysis.

To be successful in today's VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world, engineers need to be able to do more than just solving technical problems and generating technical solutions. Organisations expect engineers to also have the ability to lead oneself, lead others and even lead the business as they progress in their careers from an individual contributor to a department head.

This foundational course is designed to teach students how to lead themselves as a start before they attempt to learn how to lead others and how to lead the business. Since the first step to become a great leader is to start from within, we will begin the course by exploring what behaviours, traits and skills students display as a leader. Having gained clearer insights into who they are as a leader, we will then move on to explore the different ways in which students could develop their leadership competencies.

A mixture of lectures, journal articles, videos, class / group activities, case studies, discussions and exercises will be used throughout this course to facilitate students' understanding of leading self.

This course is the second of two parts to an integrated engineering innovate-and-design curriculum which aims to introduce a systematic engineering design process to the students and provide a design project experience to develop their design skills.  The course therefore aims to provide students with knowledge about optimizing, prototype-building and evaluating their designs, and the use of visual/graphic communication for promoting their designs, culminating in a design project with students working in teams to innovate multi-disciplinary engineering design solutions to practical problems with commercial/social/environmental considerations.

This course introduces you to the varieties of Mandarin Chinese as surfaced in Chinese speaking communities such as Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. We will illustrate with rich examples the differences in the writing system, sound, lexicon, grammar, and pragmatics found in Chinese varieties, and discuss the linguistic, historical, cultural, and social factors that have led to the differences. The course will help you get a deeper and wider understanding of language variation and change, and facilitate more effective communication with Mandarin speakers from different regions. The course is useful for future careers relevant to Chinese including language teaching, editing, translation, etc.

This course focuses on issues central to the phenomenon of bilingualism. It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world's population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

This course is an overview of some key issues in first language acquisition. It charts children's language development from birth right through the school years. The emphasis of the course is on evaluating crosslinguistic data against current theoretical models of language acquisition. Topics include phonological; morphological; grammatical; semantic and pragmatic development. The course will also evaluate the influence of the environment on the child's language development by examining studies on input and research on differences in socialisation patterns across languages. Students will have the opportunity to work with real language data from a variety of languages.

Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

Anthropological linguistics is an interdisciplinary sub-field of linguistics and anthropology that examines the link between language and culture, and they ways they influence each other. It is concerned with the role of language and meaning in their social and cultural contexts, and how they contribute to creating and perpetuating social structures and cultural practices.

This interdisciplinary course provides you with a theoretical and practical training in researching language and culture from an anthropological point of view. Though selected readings, class discussions, and first-hand experience in doing anthropological/linguistic fieldwork, at the conclusion of this course you will appreciate how the study of communicative practices in their cultural settings can reveal profound insights into the diverse ways that humans perceive and interpret their worlds.

In this course you will examine the theory and implementation of language policy and planning at all levels and explore areas where policy and planning overlap. You will also look into language activism and resistance to language planning through examining issues such as the legal status of languages and language rights; the interrelations between globalisation, nationalism, ethnicity, identity and language policy; linguistic ecology; multilingualism as a problem or resource; as well as issues on language minoritisation and endangerment. You will be guided to apply your learning to real world situations and explore ways to investigate issues empirically. This course provides you with training in core analytical skills necessary to engage in research on language planning and policy.

This is an advanced course aimed at reexamining the understanding of human communication in the age of globalization. As a research agenda, the sociolinguistics of globalization represents a relatively new, but rapidly growing and vibrant interdisciplinary approach to the place and role of language in the contemporary flows of people, capital, ideas, world views, cultural artefacts and representations. Change, mobility, and flux have come to characterize contemporary social life and social imagination, and this course will be a forum for you to engage with the relevant readings that deal with these issues from a sociolinguistic perspective. Throughout the course, we will be examining conditions and themes that have come to occupy a prominent place in the sociolinguistic research program. We will identify what new theoretical and methodological notions we need to add to our `traditional' sociolinguistic repertoire to be able to scrutinize communication and emergent regimes of language in the contexts of superdiversity, spatial and symbolic mobility, globalized economic markets, tourism, war and terrorism.

This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved.

The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.

The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.

The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)
 
will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex
orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce
detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including
those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention
will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.

The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.

The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.

The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.

Key subjects covered include:
1.	using  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of
speech production and perception;
2.	the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms
of speech production;
3.	an  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;
4.	an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;
5.	practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data.

This course is a continuation of the previous two Arabic courses offered by CML.  The course consolidates and extends the skills acquired on Arabic Language Levels 1 and 2 (ie, LA9001 and LA9002 respectively).  In this course, the usage of various grammatical constructions learnt in LA9002 are strengthened and expanded, enabling students to express themselves better in their written and oral expressions using the past, present and future tenses.  The course will enable learners to use Modern Standard Arabic in various real life situations and further enhance their ability in the four skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The course teaches students to express themselves effectively in everyday communicative interactions beyond basic survival requirements.  It enables students to use a range of complex phrases and sentence structures as well as build on their vocabulary and idiomatic expressions.  It also further develops students' ability in reading and writing in the Arabic writing system so that they can successfully read and write.  Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex audio and written texts.

This German course is a continuation of the previous three courses offered by CML. In this course the fourth case (Genitive) is introduced and the usage of various grammatical constructions learnt in LG9003 are strengthened and expanded, enabling extensive written and oral expression in past, present and future tenses. Furthermore the course focuses on the expansion of vocabulary through the usage of more complex texts (reading and listening), which will enable a more complex and diverse understanding and use of the language in a variety of daily situations and discussions. 

Although the course develops all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) a special emphasis is placed on the active language production, especially the oral aspect. Audio-visual materials are used extensively and German is used almost exclusively as the language of instruction in the classroom.  

This course is equivalent to Level A2.2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and it prepares students to sit for the official external examination Start Deutsch 2 (SD2). The examination is the official accreditation of the degree of fluency of the German Language, issued and recognized by the German government and conducted at the Goethe Institut Singapur.

This course is a progression from the Level 2 course. In this course, students are introduced to a more advanced level of sentence construction and patterns.  These are taught through the exploration of interesting and current topics of interest, which provide a stimulus to conversation.  Learners' language competency will be enhanced through drills and practices, using a guided imitation method followed by situational applications to enable immediate practical usage.  Through the introduction of formal and informal expressions, students will have a deeper understanding of the more complex Japanese social practices where the mode of speech is determined by corresponding variations in human relationships and behaviour.  Students are exposed to more sophisticated dialogues recorded for listening practice with question drills to familiarize them to native-spoken Japanese.  An addition of approximately 330 words, 30 sentence patterns and 60 kanji characters will be covered in the syllabus.

Any student who has successfully passed the Level 2 course (or its equivalent) is eligible for this course. This course aims to expand students language skills by introducing more complex sentence structures, colloquial expressions and language use in different cultural contexts. Students are introduced to the more stylistic intricacies of the language as idioms and metaphors are integrated into the syllabus. Classroom tasks in this course naturally demand a higher level of participation and hence incorporate learning through the use of audio-visual materials and class discussion. During the course, students are expected to use little or no English as the course is mainly taught in Korean. By the end of the course, students should be able to read, speak, write and understand written documents on varied topics in different forms. This course gives students practice in the skills required for TOPIK, a standardized Korean language test.

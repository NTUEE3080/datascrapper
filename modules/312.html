We begin with a brief, non-technical, conceptual introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications, suitable for students from any field. Then we focus on preparing you to participate in the global debates about the legal, policy and ethics issues that Al is already creating for humans. Among the questions considered: With AI tracking your every move on social media, what privacy protections do you have? Who is liable if an AI learns human biases and makes a racist hiring recommendation?  When our minds can be uploaded to computers, will they have legal rights? Is a self-driving car liable for killing a pedestrian? Should autonomous weapons be allowed to decide to kill a human? We compare possible answers in Singapore and American law and learn how informed citizens everywhere can shape AI's future.

Power is the defining feature of international politics and security. As such, international relations scholars focus on great power-led regional institutions, such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), for their research, because those institutions possess 'power' in shaping international politics. However, there are so many other regional political/security institutions in the world, which begs an important question: what kind of power do regional security institutions that are not led by great powers have? This seminar aims to understand material and non-material power of non-great power-led regional institutions possess in shaping international and regional politics. To this end, the seminar offers you the in-depth knowledge of non-great power-led regional security institutions in the world, ranging from Asia to the Middle East to Latin America to South America. More specifically, the seminar explores their institutional history, objectives, and functions, exploring the applicability of the existing theoretical frameworks in the IR field. This seminar is geared toward those who are interested in secondary powers in international politics and security institutions.

A study of democracy cannot take place without analyzing political parties and elections. Political parties, in the West at least, have contributed enormously to the flourishing and stability of democracy. Parties link the state and society, take part in elections and contribute towards the structuring (and re-structuring) of political processes and institutions. Yet, the nature of political parties differ throughout time and space; similarly, the nature of elections differ throughout democracies - there is significant diversity in the way the electoral systems are structured, the legislations governing elections, the frequency of elections, the way campaigns are conducted, inter alia. As such, there is a need to understand the differing types of parties and elections, the impact that they have on society and political systems, who runs in elections, how voters make their choices, and the threats to our existing understandings of democracy and elections.
This module studies the development of political parties and electoral systems, emphasizing the analytical component (how and why) in addition to the standard descriptive approach (what).

Qualitative research is an essential tool for deeper probing of diverse social phenomena and for designing effective public management strategies and policies. In the public administration and policy areas, narratives, case studies, observations, and more recently, focus groups have contributed insight and depth to our understanding of the structural, managerial, and environmental factors embedded in the public sector. Given this, you, as an independent researcher, need to understand the philosophy of qualitative, non-statistical social science research, focusing on how to design methods of qualitative research and how to conduct the analysis. The main objective of this course is not only to empower you to critically consume research through various forms of qualitative methods, but also to provide the fundamental skills for their own future rigorous research work (e.g., final year project). More specifically, while studying different qualitative inquiry approaches, you will be able to create a rationale for a qualitative inquiry that will be applicable to their research (or a hypothetical one) and to conduct qualitative research with data production (e.g., interviews, case studies, and observations). Lastly, you will be able to analyze and interpret their data using content or another discourse analytic technique. This course is organized along the following themes: (1) introduction of qualitative research, (2) research proposal outline, (3) developing and designing qualitative research, (4) observation studies, (5) interviews, (6) discourse and narrative research, (7) analysis of verbal data, (8) video data analysis, (9) case study, (10) content analysis, and (11) mixed methods.

The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

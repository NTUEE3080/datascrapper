Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

This course aims to equip students with the philosophical foundations necessary to understand theories of ethics and subsequently apply those theories to real-life scenarios and issues. It also aims to enable students to critically assess the civic institutions that structure their local and global communities. To these ends, the course will examine the nature of ethics, its understanding across different cultures, and how it is manifested in concepts, social structures, and governance institutions. Topics to be explored include human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, inequality, and sexuality. The rights and duties of citizenship shall be a unifying theme. Students will think through assumptions they hold on all of these matters. They will be provided with the tools to understand various and even contradictory perspectives on these important issues.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

We begin with a brief, non-technical, conceptual introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications, suitable for students from any field. Then we focus on preparing you to participate in the global debates about the legal, policy and ethics issues that Al is already creating for humans. Among the questions considered: With AI tracking your every move on social media, what privacy protections do you have? Who is liable if an AI learns human biases and makes a racist hiring recommendation?  When our minds can be uploaded to computers, will they have legal rights? Is a self-driving car liable for killing a pedestrian? Should autonomous weapons be allowed to decide to kill a human? We compare possible answers in Singapore and American law and learn how informed citizens everywhere can shape AI's future.

This course introduces basic principles and methods of social scientific research. These skills are required for marketing, public relations, and communication campaigns based on research, and for measuring campaign effectiveness. Regardless of your career path, these skills are increasingly essential for us as citizens and consumers, to understand public discourse and policy debates that draw on the findings of research studies.

Conducting research is critical for some career paths in communication, marketing, and public relations, and for those who pursue further graduate study or academic careers in research.

Though many of the examples will be of communication research, much of the material is applicable to all social and behavioral sciences, and even physical and mathematical sciences.
The lectures will present the critical content for the course, and the tutorials are designed to allow for reflection and application of the key concepts. While there will be opportunities for discussion during lecture, the tutorials are where most of the in-person dialogue will occur. An online discussion forum is also available for students to pose questions and share ideas related to the course.

We are all media users and whether we are conscious about it or not, the media we use affect us. We need to understand what we do with the media as well as what the media can do to us. That's part of media literacy. But as mass communicators, we also need to understand how what we do affects others. That's part of being responsible. Thankfully, 'media effects' is a rich and popular area of mass communication research. In this class, we will be studying old and new research on how the media shape our experience and existence.

This course covers the principles and techniques of data mining for extracting information from large amounts of numerical data. The information mined from data is often in the form of associations, patterns or specific facts, that can be synthesized to create new knowledge, construct prediction models or used in decision making. The class will be run partly in a project-based/problem-based style. Lab sessions and the class project will provide students with hands-on experience with a data mining software. The approach taken in the course is a how-to-do-it, how-does-it-work and how-to-apply-it kind of approach, to develop the student's common sense ability to manipulate and analyze data intelligently for deriving new knowledge or supporting decision making.

Principals of Microeconomics has introduced basic concepts in market and discussed how  markets work in general. The aim of this course is to deepen the understanding of behaviors in the market by further examining the decision process of economic agents and the implied welfare consequences. 

In the first half of the course, we focus on how individuals make their decisions in the market by discussing two broad topics. The first is the analysis of price and income changes in the market. This discussion builds on what have already been covered in Principals of Microeconomics. The second topic is individual decision-making regarding time, risk, and uncertainty where we will also examine how the asset market works. 

In the second half of the course, we focus on analysing the welfare effects of outcomes in markets and society. To this end, students will learn different measures of welfare and criteria for efficiency, and how perfectly competitive markets help achieve socially optimal outcomes. Subsequently, we will discuss the problems related to making choices for society and how these may be reconciled.

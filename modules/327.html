With digitalization now becoming the new normal in our daily life, this course seeks to equip students from different disciplines with problem-solving techniques with the aid of computers and to enable them to acquire some common but essential digital skills that are crucial in today's workforce. In this course, students will learn how to apply the concept of computational thinking and quantitative reasoning to solve problem and analyse data. They will also learn how to identify online threats and understand the principles of ethics and intellectual property rights in the digital world. They will also be exposed to current issues in the digital world, which they can better understand through the logics of computational thinking and quantitative reasoning, such as cybersecurity and the rise of fake news. In addition, students will also learn how to use some of the latest online tools for effective presentation, communication, and collaborative skills in teams while learning the course.

This course aims to equip students with the philosophical foundations necessary to understand theories of ethics and subsequently apply those theories to real-life scenarios and issues. It also aims to enable students to critically assess the civic institutions that structure their local and global communities. To these ends, the course will examine the nature of ethics, its understanding across different cultures, and how it is manifested in concepts, social structures, and governance institutions. Topics to be explored include human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, inequality, and sexuality. The rights and duties of citizenship shall be a unifying theme. Students will think through assumptions they hold on all of these matters. They will be provided with the tools to understand various and even contradictory perspectives on these important issues.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

The course aims to inspire a long-lasting mindset of awareness, critical thinking, curiosity, and collaboration across disciplines through the lens of current sustainability challenges. You will learn to analyze sustainability issues from different perspectives (social, economic, and environmental) and on different scales (individual, organizational, Singaporean, and global). You will then use these skills to discuss and propose solutions for sustainability challenges facing Singapore and the world.

HY0001 will introduce students to three major ethical theories' utilitarianism, Kant's deontology, and virtue ethics. Then, four weeks will be devoted to teaching the ethical principles underlying academic integrity, research ethics, and intellectual property. Finally, students will discuss issues related to the ethics of environmental sustainability and conservation. All the while, students will be challenged apply the ethical theories learned to concrete moral problems, including world poverty, corporate accountability and whistleblowing, and workplace discrimination.

This course aims to first develop students' understanding in the fundamental concepts, implementations and applications associated with data structures in computing such as arrays, stacks, queues and linked lists, and to use such data structures to solve real world problems. Abstract data types and dynamic memory allocation will also be covered. You are then introduced to the hardware architecture and the operation of a typical microprocessor that is used in a computer, how it functions and how it is programmed to solve problems. Students also learn how to program a microprocessor using assembly language that resembles very closely the machines codes executed by the CPU, and how high level language program is translated to the machines codes, which provide insights to good coding styles. You will then be introduced to the fundamental knowledge of Linux based system running on low-power devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi board) and the common Linux operational commands. This will enable you to learn how to setup the multimedia tools and implement machine learning applications (e.g., object detection, facial recognition etc. on the Raspberry Pi board), as well as to design and to program an innovative application.

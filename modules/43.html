This course aims to provide you with the general knowledge and basic training of mathematics in biology. In this course, you will go back to the early days of biological research to recognize that some great discoveries in biology were possible only through application of mathematics. Additionally, you will study a few biological phenomena that most of you are familiar with, such as Mendelian genetics, population genetics, gene mapping, bacterial mutation, and enzyme catalysis. During the online course, you will learn how to 'translate' a biological problem into 'mathematical language' called an equation. Then you solve the equation by using mathematical tools and arrive at a 'solution' which is one of the equations of life. Finally, you will apply the equation to life situation to test whether the equation has been able to unravel the mystery that you were concerned with at the beginning.

Singapore is currently an exciting place for Bioentrepreneurship and the bioindustry is an area where many activities are taking place and where opportunities abound. The huge capital and energy input into life sciences is a pillar for our country's economy and it is a strong indication of the tremendous opportunity that is present in this field. In this course, we will not only show you the structure of Bioentrepreneurship, but also impart the spirit and essence of it. Bioentrepreneurship and the launching of new ventures aims to create or build something new or different that has an impact on one's dream and also on peoples' lives and ultimately on the society. It will lead to new and improved products/services and create new jobs and added value for owners, investors and the society. Starting up a bioventure usually requires more money than you have in the bank, more energy than you thought you had and more skills &amp; know-how than you thought you needed.The knowledge you will gain will be of good value in your future professional life not only in start-up of business ventures but also in any position you will have in bioindustry.

The students will be provided with a set of initial problems to solve. To solve these problems, a hands-on approach will adopted that will make use of a range of different biophysical techniques. Each of these techniques will provide different types of information about the samples. An important aspect that will be emphasized is to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and to be able to design experiments knowing which techniques should be used first, and which last. 

Each daily session will consist of two parts (morning and afternoon). Each part will start will a 30 min briefing and will end up with a collation of results session and discussion. All days will have associated a pre-recorded video lecture for support, but a live 30 minute briefing will precede all sessions. 
In the first part we will look at ways to determine protein concentration using visible and UV light, and to measure the size of larger particles such as liposomes or detergent micelles using dynamic light scattering. 
The second part will look at how to obtain secondary structure information to assess proper folding, from infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism.  
The third part of the course will focus on size and oligomerization of molecules, and how this can be determined. To do this, we will use standard centrifugation techniques and also analytical ultracentrifugation (velocity and sedimentation).    
The fourth part will look at function, using kast kinetics (stopped flow), fluorescence and channel activity in model lipid bilayers. Inhibition by small molecules will be tested and dose response plots will be used to determine the affinity of the drugs.

This one-week course aims to introduce students to the taxonomic and molecular techniques utilized as a part of the toolkit of the modern botanist. This course includes lectures, a field trip and laboratory experiments, all of which will be held at the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG). Through the field trip, you will learn how a plant taxonomist uses morphological characters to classify species. For the laboratory aspect, you will learn how to perform DNA extraction and preparation of DNA libraries for high throughput sequencing. You will then assemble DNA markers to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree and, in combination with data on morphological traits, interpret your results and form conclusions regarding phylogenetic relationships between the species of interest.

The aim of this course is to understand pathologic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases at the molecular and cellular level. The hallmark of those aging-associated diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, is protein aggregation that occurs when protein homeostasis collapses. Cellular protein homeostasis is maintained by regulating protein synthesis, folding and degradation. Therefore, this course will address the whole life cycle of proteins and you will learn how failure of each step of the cycle is linked with neurodegenerative diseases. Various genes and pathways involved in aging are also an important topic of the course. This course will help you understand why debilitating neurodegenerative diseases are on the increase in our society and how to approach to cure them.

The electronic communications environment and the internet challenges how businesses protect their informational assets. This course is designed to prepare the candidate to evaluate the strategies needed to face these challenges. This course also looks at the potential liability and the prevention of the misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis, interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with brands - embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works.

This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in Intellectual Property law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication - or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.

This course aims to provide a firm understanding of marketing and is designed for students who have chosen to specialise in disciplines other than business. As you may already know, a working knowledge of marketing is beneficial wherever your career takes you. We will discuss basic principles of marketing. However, the focus is on its application and how this understanding could potentially enhance your future performance in your chosen field. A hands-on approach is expected and activities have been incorporated to encourage observation and enhance analytical ability. The course will require you to analyse businesses, evaluate alternatives, collaborate with team members, lead discussions, present your analysis and propose recommendations on selected organisations.

The course will begin by discussing sustainable marketing in the global context. We continue with marketing strategy and customer value. This requires an understanding of the business environment and buyer behaviour. We then focus on the 4 P?s, namely product, price, place and promotion.

Communication with the market is an important activity for many businesses and organizations. It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.

The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives.

The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities.

Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

BU8601 is an introductory course for non-business undergraduates to help you understand, think and act like managers. Knowledge and skills gained from this course will help you in any situation where you need to manage yourself and other people.

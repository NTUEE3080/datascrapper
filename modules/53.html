This course aims to provide you with the general knowledge and basic training of mathematics in biology. In this course, you will go back to the early days of biological research to recognize that some great discoveries in biology were possible only through application of mathematics. Additionally, you will study a few biological phenomena that most of you are familiar with, such as Mendelian genetics, population genetics, gene mapping, bacterial mutation, and enzyme catalysis. During the online course, you will learn how to 'translate' a biological problem into 'mathematical language' called an equation. Then you solve the equation by using mathematical tools and arrive at a 'solution' which is one of the equations of life. Finally, you will apply the equation to life situation to test whether the equation has been able to unravel the mystery that you were concerned with at the beginning.

Singapore is currently an exciting place for Bioentrepreneurship and the bioindustry is an area where many activities are taking place and where opportunities abound. The huge capital and energy input into life sciences is a pillar for our country's economy and it is a strong indication of the tremendous opportunity that is present in this field. In this course, we will not only show you the structure of Bioentrepreneurship, but also impart the spirit and essence of it. Bioentrepreneurship and the launching of new ventures aims to create or build something new or different that has an impact on one's dream and also on peoples' lives and ultimately on the society. It will lead to new and improved products/services and create new jobs and added value for owners, investors and the society. Starting up a bioventure usually requires more money than you have in the bank, more energy than you thought you had and more skills &amp; know-how than you thought you needed.The knowledge you will gain will be of good value in your future professional life not only in start-up of business ventures but also in any position you will have in bioindustry.

In this course, we will learn to use biophysical techniques to find out information about different types of proteins, in terms of concentration, secondary structure, oligomeric state, reconstitution systems using both detergent and lipid, purity, function and inhibition. 

The students will be provided with a set of initial problems to solve. To solve these problems, a hands-on approach will adopted that will make use of a range of different biophysical techniques. Each of these techniques will provide different types of information about the samples. An important aspect that will be emphasized is to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and to be able to design experiments knowing which techniques should be used first, and which last. 

Each daily session will consist of two parts (morning and afternoon). Each part will start will a 30 min briefing and will end up with a collation of results session and discussion. All days will have associated a pre-recorded video lecture for support, but a live 30 minute briefing will precede all sessions. 
In the first part we will look at ways to determine protein concentration using visible and UV light, and to measure the size of larger particles such as liposomes or detergent micelles using dynamic light scattering. 
The second part will look at how to obtain secondary structure information to assess proper folding, from infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism.  
The third part of the course will focus on size and oligomerization of molecules, and how this can be determined. To do this, we will use standard centrifugation techniques and also analytical ultracentrifugation (velocity and sedimentation).    
The fourth part will look at function, using kast kinetics (stopped flow), fluorescence and channel activity in model lipid bilayers. Inhibition by small molecules will be tested and dose response plots will be used to determine the affinity of the drugs.

Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

This is an introductory module to provide an overview of the field of abnormal psychology.  The course discusses a variety of psychological conditions and human behaviors that are traditionally considered outside of what we see as 'normal.'  We will explore the major approaches to understanding these psychological disorders described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM; the most recent version is the fifth edition [DSM-5]), their manifestations, causes, risk factors, assessments, and treatments.  The course emphasizes the scientific and research aspects of abnormal psychology.  That is, it focuses on the knowledge obtained by rigorous scientific research methods.  At the end of this module, students should have an overall understanding of the various psychological disorders and be able to provide an account of abnormal behaviors and psychological disorders observed in daily life.  It is also the goal of this course that students achieve greater understanding and appreciation for the range of human behaviors.  In addition, this course provides a foundation for other more advanced courses that cover the understanding and treatment strategies for psychological disorders.  The knowledge learned in this course will serve as the foundation for related fields in health sciences, including clinical psychology, psychological counseling, social work, and rehabilitation.

Psychologists have long studied the human condition in its many manifestations of weaknesses, damages and maladaptive behaviors. Yet, the discipline of psychology must also understand and appreciate the character, strengths and virtues of human life, including those relevant to the concepts of happiness, hope, motivation, mindfulness, resilience, gratitude and compassion, all of which enable individuals to thrive and flourish, while contributing to the health and well-being of family and society.

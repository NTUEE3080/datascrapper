This course is designed to help students understand and implement techniques that underlie research on the management of human resources in organizations. Research plays an integral role in the management of people in today's organizations. Companies value talent with the skills to apply scientific research practices to help improve employee productivity and well-being. Similarly, many organizations also engage external consultants to help solve problems with their workforce via research. This course will equip students with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to function as both internal and external research consultants. The course begins with discussions of the principles of scientific research, and how they can be applied in a HR context. We then progress to cover the various aspects of designing, analyzing, interpreting, and reporting on appropriate research to investigate HR-related issues. Learning is cultivated through discourse and activities geared toward providing students with hands-on experience of the consulting and research processes.

Employment Law is critical to managing human capital. This course focuses on the employment law in Singapore as a foundation for an understanding of the employment relationship and its incidents. The course examines how the law determines the employment relationship from a contract for service (associated with independent contractors) as the cornerstone of the employment relationship. The rights and obligations of the parties are examined not only at the contractual level, but also from the wider perspective of the common law, statutory framework (where applicable) and other sources of law which impinge on the employment relationship. The course also examines how and when the employment relationship comes to an end - by proper termination, summary dismissal, frustration, threat of harm, etc and highlights claims for wrongful and unfair dismissal, and other remedies available to both the employer and the employee.

Besides a sound working grasp of the basic legal principles, the course is also intended to provide perspectives, theoretical and practical, from which to critically assess the possible solutions and the law's responses to vital problems commonly encountered both in Singapore and abroad. Selected topics are given a comparative international treatment.

This course aims to develop your Cultural Intelligence (CQ) - the ability to deal effectively with people from different cultural backgrounds (Ang &amp; Van Dyne, 2008)1. This course is designed for business undergraduates who are interested to learn how to deal with the challenges of working in culturally diverse environments (e.g., employees in MNCs, global projects, expatriation). For more than 20 years, research has shown that CQ is a differentiating attribute of global talents and leaders in the borderless world of the 21st century. General cognitive intelligence and emotional intelligence are no longer enough to lead successful global careers. The good news is that CQ is a skill that can be developed and learnt by almost anyone. In this course, we will focus on equipping you with a set of practical skills to manage intercultural relations at work and enhance your global talent profile as a result.

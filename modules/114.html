This course is intended for students interested in the meanings of being a Chinese overseas in a rapidly changing world. It investigates the changing relations Chinese overseas have with China and the factors underlying these changes. It first looks at Overseas Chinese's concern about China's political upheaval and social disorder before 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded. It then examines the isolation of Chinese overseas from China between 1949 and 1978, because of the radical political movements in China and nation-building projects in their countries of residence. It subsequently explores the responses of Chinese overseas after 1978 when China launched economic reform. This course provides you with the necessary knowledge for future courses in HC4060 and HC4061.

This course combines a variety of texts and gender/sexuality research theories in order to discuss issues of sex and gender/sexuality in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. These include sexual attractiveness and sexual desire in pre-Qin and Qin/Han literature, lust and eroticism in Ming/Qing literature, the destruction of family and the abandonment of marriage in early modern Chinese literature, love in friendship and the construction of masculinity, Chinese feminism and female sexual desire, new sexual morality discourse and the great debate on love, the first and second waves of feminism, and queer theory. By tracing the development and changes in Chinese concepts of gender/sexuality from ancient times to the present day, this course aims to ensure that you can, while remaining rooted in history, refer to constructions of knowledge in Western gender/sexuality culture and theory and proceed to rethink and deepen the contemporary discussion on these topics on an individual and societal level.

Globalization implies escalated pace of free flow of people, capital, and ideas across political boundaries. While national framework still exercises constraint on those lacking resource to move, a signification portion of Chinese overseas demonstrates high transnational mobility. This course first reviews the concepts associated with globalization. Then it examines the extent to which the Chinese overseas have been globalized. It also studies the obstacles to and impacts on Chinese overseas in their efforts in the process of globalization.

This course focuses on issues central to the phenomenon of bilingualism. It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world's population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

In this course, we will look at how language is used to construct taken-for-granted stories, metaphors and ideologies that perpetuate environmentally harmful modes of human existence. We'll take an eco-critical perspective and develop an analytical toolkit that we'll apply to various discourses, including those referred to as `environmentalist'. We will analyze a wide range of texts (pieces of journalistic, academic and policy writing, excerpts from textbooks, advertisements, mission statements and `about us' sections of various companies and corporations, examples of `green initiatives' and environmentalist campaigning, blogs, literary narratives and poetry), and unpack the main tropes, frames and strategies through which environmentally hazardous discourses become normalized. We will also look for the alternatives that promote ecological harmony. Our major topics include but are not limited to: development, growth, progress, climate change, animal rights, nature-as-resource, individualism, consumerism, culturally constructed images of the ideal body and food consumption. The course will provide a stimulating environment for you to enhance your critical thinking skills and acquire concepts that will serve you well in many prospective careers, especially in industries with environmental and sustainability concerns. And those are many.

Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

Anthropological linguistics is an interdisciplinary sub-field of linguistics and anthropology that examines the link between language and culture, and they ways they influence each other. It is concerned with the role of language and meaning in their social and cultural contexts, and how they contribute to creating and perpetuating social structures and cultural practices.

This interdisciplinary course provides you with a theoretical and practical training in researching language and culture from an anthropological point of view. Though selected readings, class discussions, and first-hand experience in doing anthropological/linguistic fieldwork, at the conclusion of this course you will appreciate how the study of communicative practices in their cultural settings can reveal profound insights into the diverse ways that humans perceive and interpret their worlds.

This is an advanced course aimed at reexamining the understanding of human communication in the age of globalization. As a research agenda, the sociolinguistics of globalization represents a relatively new, but rapidly growing and vibrant interdisciplinary approach to the place and role of language in the contemporary flows of people, capital, ideas, world views, cultural artefacts and representations. Change, mobility, and flux have come to characterize contemporary social life and social imagination, and this course will be a forum for you to engage with the relevant readings that deal with these issues from a sociolinguistic perspective. Throughout the course, we will be examining conditions and themes that have come to occupy a prominent place in the sociolinguistic research program. We will identify what new theoretical and methodological notions we need to add to our `traditional' sociolinguistic repertoire to be able to scrutinize communication and emergent regimes of language in the contexts of superdiversity, spatial and symbolic mobility, globalized economic markets, tourism, war and terrorism.

This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved.

The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.

The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.

The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)
 
will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex
orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce
detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including
those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention
will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.

The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.

The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.

The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.

Key subjects covered include:
1.	using  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of
speech production and perception;
2.	the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms
of speech production;
3.	an  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;
4.	an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;
5.	practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data.

This course aims to provide you with the necessary introductory accounting knowledge to
understand how to use financial statement information to make economic decisions from a user
perspective such as investors and creditors. In the process, you will learn to prepare a basic set
of financial statements in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards.
The course also examines the impact of various accounting choices on the financial statements
and the incentives that contracts based on accounting numbers can create for different
stakeholders. This will help you understand why managers choose certain accounting methods
and avoid others. This learning forms the foundation for further studies in areas which require
accounting knowledge.

Previously, BC2406 introduced core concepts of Business Analytics and the important models in used by businesses and governments. However, there are more complex situations that require more sophisticated Analytics solutions. BC2407 is the continuation of BC2406. The main objective of BC2407 is to introduce students to advanced Analytics techniques to extract more useful and deeper insights under more complex realistic situations. At the end of the course, students will see the strengths and weaknesses of standard models, and learn advanced techniques to overcome the weaknesses in various scenarios. This course builds upon open source R software (as learnt in BC2406), and introduced a commercial software SAS, commonly used in Banks, Pharmaceuticals, MNCs and some government agencies. Students will learn the differences between R and SAS in both the model development phrase and in the standard software outputs.

Supply chain analytics is a set of approaches utilized to efficiently integrate suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses and stores and to efficiently manage material, information and financial flows so that merchandise is produced and distributed at the right quantities, to the right locations, and at the right time, in order to maximize system-wide surplus or value. It plays an important role in today's global economy, because efficient supply chains not only make companies more profitable but also allow customers to receive better products at lower prices. For business and technology management students, it becomes critical to have a good understanding of supply chains and its vital role as a source of both performance improvement and business innovation.

In this era of big data, many companies and public organizations invest heavily in various flavors of analytics: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. Among them, prescriptive analytics goes beyond what happened (descriptive analytics), what will happen (predictive analytics), and provides insights into what to do to help companies and public organizations make better decisions.
This course aims to introduce students to the theory and applications of prescriptive analytics: how to go from data to optimal decision-making. It contains two principal components (1) Data-driven optimization theories and techniques and (2) Important business applications in finance, investment, and operations management.
Optimization theories such as linear optimization, discrete optimization, network optimization, quadratic optimization, stochastic optimization, and robust optimization will be covered in this course, with applications in portfolio selection, asset allocation, risk management, revenue management, pricing and hedging of options, asset/liability management, appointment scheduling, retail operations, inventory management, and assets repositioning in a sharing economy.
We will also place a specific focus on analyzing real data and solving optimization models using Python with commercial solver Gurobi*.

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard phrases such as `globalization,' `multinational corporation,' and `cross-border transactions,' 
and this course will discuss these ideas in some detail. Yet, despite the appeal of international business, many companies find that the process is not at all easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment.
This elective course aims to provide you with a clear basis of the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders. The course will address the various dimensions that shape the international business environment, as well as those factors that impact businesses themselves. You will be able to identify and understand issues that affect globalization and the international business environment. You should also be able to apply this understanding to design optimal responses to an international business environment created and impacted by these factors.
The course will develop your ability to analyse the countries you would like to do business in. It will help you to analyse and understand the macro and industry environment, develop an entry strategy, as well as an appropriate business model and business plan.
Students interested in the international business environment will find this course useful.

The course aims to equip students with the tools and techniques to become informed users of financial statement information. Students will learn fundamental accounting principles, understand a wide range of business transactions, and appreciate how users such as equity investors, creditors, financial analysts and managers employ financial accounting information for decision making. Students will also examine the impact of different accounting choices on reported earnings, assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity. By integrating the knowledge of accounting, finance and economics, students will achieve a holistic view on how business transactions are accounted for and the strategic implications of financial statement information. Students will develop skills in analysing financial statements for investment, credit and other business decisions. 

Throughout the course, real-world applications will be provided to enhance students' learning. Due to large similarities among US Financial Reporting Standards (US GAAP), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS (I)) for most of the topics covered in this course, we will focus on SFRS (I). Any major differences between SFRS (I) and IFRS (and/or US GAAP) will be highlighted where appropriate. In summary, this course aims to provide students with a strong technical foundation in financial statements analysis from the user perspective

This course is an introduction to mathematical finance. The course serves to equip students with basic mathematical knowledge and computational skills needed to solve problems related to finance. Furthermore, this course lays the foundation for more advanced topics, such as econometrics, stochastic calculus and optimal control theory, which make finance a very exciting subject.
Modern finance draws upon many fields of mathematics, in particular, algebra, econometrics, numerical analysis, optimization theory, partial differential equations, probability theory, statistics and stochastic calculus. The diversity of mathematical skills needed to master finance makes it a very challenging subject for students.
The mathematical topics covered in this course include matrix algebra, calculus, difference equation, differential equation, optimization and portfolio mathematics (please refer to the proposed seminar schedule for details). The topics in the first five weeks of the course introduce students to the simplest financial market model and explain arbitrage pricing in a discrete time framework. The topics in the next three weeks lay the foundations for continuous time finance. The topics in the last four weeks introduce students to optimization and portfolio theory. These selected topics serve as an introduction to some of the fields of mathematics that modern finance draws upon.

Many companies engage in cross-border business and they face important financial questions beyond those found in a purely domestic setting. This course endeavours to provide the basic understanding and tools to evaluate, finance, and manage international business. The issues and tools discuss are particularly relevant to highly open economies, such as Singapore, where companies will engage in international business. In this course, we will describe the global financial markets that facilitate international business and explain the key economic linkages among them. In the context of international finance, understanding foreign exchange rates is crucial. We will therefore explain exchange rates and those factors that affect the rates. We will then examine the challenges for companies created by unexpected changes in exchange rates. We will also discuss how these firms should manage their exposure to currency fluctuations. Lastly, we will explore areas of international corporate finance like capital budgeting and financing from the perspective of multinational companies.

This course is an introductory course on financial derivatives and derivatives-linked investments. The derivatives covered include forwards, futures, swaps and options on different underlying assets like stocks, stock indices, commodities and foreign exchange. Through this course, students will learn the features of various derivatives and how to price, value (calculate the Profit/Loss) and structure them for investment and risk management. Students will also learn basic and slightly more advance option strategies and how to use them for hedging and trading. They will be able to design arbitrage strategies to take advantage of mispricing in various derivatives. A good understanding of derivatives and its usage/abuses is a prerequisite for effective management of any company as financial risks can cause substantial damage to the P/L of an otherwise well managed firm. Graduates with solid grounding in derivative investments can take up careers as traders, derivatives specialists/advisors, derivatives sales experts, financial engineers and risk managers in treasury departments, trading floors, asset management and risk management divisions in banks and major corporates. On an individual level, understanding of derivatives will help one to appreciate the risk and rewards in the many derivatives-linked investments now increasingly made available to retail investors.

The objective of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive coverage of the principles and techniques in equity securities analysis. Valuation is at the heart of every investment decision. Due to the globalization process and ever-changing dynamics of the modern financial markets, the pricing of any financial assets has become a more complex task. This course will cover both theory and applications of many different asset valuation models and highlight their strength and weaknesses. Therefore, this course will be especially useful for students who are considering a career in investment and wealth management areas.

Investment firms increasingly draw from big data as they manage their financial assets. The growing relevance of big data in the investment industry increasingly requires that students who are interested in a career in finance be deeply familiar with big data and the use of big data in investments. The goal of this course is to provide interested students with such knowledge and insight. Students will learn about the different types of big data and how they may be applied to different types of investment styles. Students will learn how to program in SAS. Students will utilize their newly acquired programming skills in a series of hands-on projects with actual, real-world data and learn how to incorporate both structured and unstructured big data into their investment decisions. While the course will focus on equity investing, the knowledge and skills acquired in this course are easily transferable to other financial assets, such as fixed income securities and real estate.

This course is designed to help students understand and implement techniques that underlie research on the management of human resources in organizations. Research plays an integral role in the management of people in today's organizations. Companies value talent with the skills to apply scientific research practices to help improve employee productivity and well-being. Similarly, many organizations also engage external consultants to help solve problems with their workforce via research. This course will equip students with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to function as both internal and external research consultants. The course begins with discussions of the principles of scientific research, and how they can be applied in a HR context. We then progress to cover the various aspects of designing, analyzing, interpreting, and reporting on appropriate research to investigate HR-related issues. Learning is cultivated through discourse and activities geared toward providing students with hands-on experience of the consulting and research processes.

Employment Law is critical to managing human capital. This course focuses on the employment law in Singapore as a foundation for an understanding of the employment relationship and its incidents. The course examines how the law determines the employment relationship from a contract for service (associated with independent contractors) as the cornerstone of the employment relationship. The rights and obligations of the parties are examined not only at the contractual level, but also from the wider perspective of the common law, statutory framework (where applicable) and other sources of law which impinge on the employment relationship. The course also examines how and when the employment relationship comes to an end - by proper termination, summary dismissal, frustration, threat of harm, etc and highlights claims for wrongful and unfair dismissal, and other remedies available to both the employer and the employee.

Besides a sound working grasp of the basic legal principles, the course is also intended to provide perspectives, theoretical and practical, from which to critically assess the possible solutions and the law's responses to vital problems commonly encountered both in Singapore and abroad. Selected topics are given a comparative international treatment.

This course aims to develop your Cultural Intelligence (CQ) - the ability to deal effectively with people from different cultural backgrounds (Ang &amp; Van Dyne, 2008)1. This course is designed for business undergraduates who are interested to learn how to deal with the challenges of working in culturally diverse environments (e.g., employees in MNCs, global projects, expatriation). For more than 20 years, research has shown that CQ is a differentiating attribute of global talents and leaders in the borderless world of the 21st century. General cognitive intelligence and emotional intelligence are no longer enough to lead successful global careers. The good news is that CQ is a skill that can be developed and learnt by almost anyone. In this course, we will focus on equipping you with a set of practical skills to manage intercultural relations at work and enhance your global talent profile as a result.

Leading and managing change is often cited as one of the top leadership priorities in organizations. Yet a significant number of organisations reported high failure rate in driving change initiatives. While employees are told that 'the only constant is change', they often do not get much positive experience when supporting organizational change efforts. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences. This is because change occurs at multiple levels, from individual's mindset change to group, and even organization. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation. Business leaders, together with their Human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations. The aim of this course is to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change.

The electronic communications environment and the internet challenges how businesses protect their informational assets. This course is designed to prepare the candidate to evaluate the strategies needed to face these challenges. This course also looks at the potential liability and the prevention of the misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis, interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with brands - embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works.

This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in Intellectual Property law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication - or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.

As a result of the interconnected nature of the global economy we need to acknowledge the role that Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer relationships plays in marketing. The impact and prevalence of these relationships mean that they should be at the heart of firms' decision making. This course helps students understand the reality of the business markets and the tasks of managing the complex, multiple and overlapping relationships in which firms are enmeshed and on which they can rely for competitive success. It moves away from the traditional 4Ps (product, pricing, promotion and place) paradigm and take a more holistic and integrated approach in understanding marketing. In addition, a strong relational approach is used in opposite to a transactional view of marketing. Marketing is viewed in this course as the process of managing and optimizing relationships, networks and interactions.

Consumers today are bombarded with thousands of messages on a daily basis. Consumers are also more skeptical, more fragmented and more difficult to reach than before. To meet these challenges, it is increasingly important for companies to develop a coherent marketing communication strategy. Marketers also need to keep searching for new ways to communicate with the consumers and make sure that the messages about their brands are perceived by the target consumers as they originally intend. As you will learn in this course, integrated marketing communications (IMC) is one of the fundamental building block for a company's strategy and success.

Marketing Channel is one of the most important assets in the organization's overall marketing strategy in this era where there exists much congestion in the market for similar products. Organizations must reach their consumers effectively but then how should we approach them? Innovation can come from 'place' by focusing on 'How do my customers want to buy?'  

Even with the same product, channel design and management could make that difference between success and failure, which we define as 'explosive channel value'. This course is designed to help understand the key elements of the marketing channels and appreciate the value of the question 'how do my customers want to buy?' Also, help future marketers (you) to apply the channel concepts into a real world. 

By taking this course, you will be provided with a foundation and framework in auditing/designing marketing distribution strategies. More specifically, you be equipped with tools to audit the current channel design and framework to create the explosive channel value, which involve both consumer-centric perspectives as well as firm-centric perspective. You will also be exposed to management issues in distribution channels.

The brands that a firm has invested in and developed over time are typically their most valuable assets. Product designs, manufacturing processes and other business processes may be easily copied, but a strong brand is something that cannot be easily reproduced. Many Asian companies are coming to terms with the importance of branding and are putting more resources into building a strong brand. This is evident from the number of branding awards (e.g., Singapore Promising Brand Award, Readers' Digest Most Trusted Brand Award etc.) being handed out in recent years. Companies are also paying top dollars for branding managers. This course aims to inform students about the current theories and findings on how firms manage brands.

The electronic communications environment and the internet challenges how businesses protect their informational assets. This course is designed to prepare the candidate to evaluate the strategies needed to face these challenges. This course also looks at the potential liability and the prevention of the misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis, interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with brands - embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works.

This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in Intellectual Property law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication - or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.

Purpose: Practical Ethics is a course intended to introduce the elements of ethical reasoning, and several principal concepts of core theories in the main branches of normative ethics. We ask the questions: What is its nature? And, how does it work? The case for its reality and its rationally binding objectivity will be defended, then the main branches of ethical theories outlined. These include utilitarianism, Kantian duty ethics and the ideas of the virtue and natural law ethical tradition stemming from Aristotle and Aquinas. A brief overview of theories of justice (including those of Rawls, Nozick and Sen) will be made. And it is intended that these concepts will be critically applied to the interface between ethics and law and the market, and some of paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, in a series of case studies under the headings: Profit, People, Planet. 

Intended Audience: It is a participation intensive course for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. These may include: corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and labour rights (people), and environmental sustainability (planet). 

Value: The course is intended to provide a breath of vision and understanding that will stand our students in good stead should they decide to pursue deeper studies in any particular area of ethics and as a basis for thinking their way around the concrete moral challenges of modern business and life.

This course aims to provide a firm understanding of marketing and is designed for students who have chosen to specialise in disciplines other than business. As you may already know, a working knowledge of marketing is beneficial wherever your career takes you. We will discuss basic principles of marketing. However, the focus is on its application and how this understanding could potentially enhance your future performance in your chosen field. A hands-on approach is expected and activities have been incorporated to encourage observation and enhance analytical ability. The course will require you to analyse businesses, evaluate alternatives, collaborate with team members, lead discussions, present your analysis and propose recommendations on selected organisations.

The course will begin by discussing sustainable marketing in the global context. We continue with marketing strategy and customer value. This requires an understanding of the business environment and buyer behaviour. We then focus on the 4 P?s, namely product, price, place and promotion.

Communication with the market is an important activity for many businesses and organizations. It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.

The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives.

The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities.

Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

This course will introduce students to the field of neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience. Neuromarketing involves capturing consumers' subconscious responses to brands, products and marketing materials in order to predict their purchasing behaviour more accurately than traditional market research methods (e.g. focus groups and surveys which are confounded by the fact that many times people either don't tell the truth about what they think or they don't know how they feel). The approach is now widely used by multinational companies to develop superior products that will also succeed in a global marketplace. The course will delve into the range of different neuromarketing techniques that are currently available (e.g. eyetracking while people use websites to see what they are attending to, monitoring brain activity while they viewing adverts or new product ideas to measure their emotions etc) and discuss the pros and cons of the different methods. Case studies will be used to demonstrate how the different approaches are being used by companies to tackle a very wide range of marketing questions. Students will also learn how insights from the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience can be applied in order to make marketing messages and communications more attention grabbing, more memorable and emotionally engaging. Also covered will be emerging research showing how digital technology is re-wiring the human brain and changing our behaviour in subtle ways but which marketers need to understand in order to create campaigns and messages that will be effective in today's digital environment. This course is vital for anyone who wants to understand consumers or customers at a deep, emotional level and to be able to market messages to consumers with greater precision.

Virtual teams have been increasingly common in organizations during the past two decades as a result of globalization and advancement in technology. The pandemic in 2020 has made working virtually an essential part of one's work life. Some world-leading companies such as Facebook has started planning for employees to work from home permanently ('within a decade as many as half of the company's more than 48,000 employees would work from home' according to Mark Zuckerberg, May 21, 2020, The New York Times). As Covid-19 has changed our lives and the way people work, it is important and timely to understand how virtual teams work. Virtual teams will not only determine the fate of organizations, but also affect the personal, social, and professional lives of individuals. The importance and complexity of virtual teams have attracted researchers worldwide to conduct hundreds of scientific studies over the years. As can be foreseen, more attention will be paid to virtual teams in the years to come in a post-pandemic world. This course provides an in-depth presentation and discussion of theories regarding virtual teams, frontier research findings on virtual teams, how they apply to our real-life situations, and opportunities to practice and develop the skills to take part in and eventually to lead virtual teams in our future professional lives.

Effective decision making is an essential skill everyone should have. Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions.

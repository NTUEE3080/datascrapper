This course is intended for students interested in the meanings of being a Chinese overseas in a rapidly changing world. It investigates the changing relations Chinese overseas have with China and the factors underlying these changes. It first looks at Overseas Chinese's concern about China's political upheaval and social disorder before 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded. It then examines the isolation of Chinese overseas from China between 1949 and 1978, because of the radical political movements in China and nation-building projects in their countries of residence. It subsequently explores the responses of Chinese overseas after 1978 when China launched economic reform. This course provides you with the necessary knowledge for future courses in HC4060 and HC4061.

This course combines a variety of texts and gender/sexuality research theories in order to discuss issues of sex and gender/sexuality in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. These include sexual attractiveness and sexual desire in pre-Qin and Qin/Han literature, lust and eroticism in Ming/Qing literature, the destruction of family and the abandonment of marriage in early modern Chinese literature, love in friendship and the construction of masculinity, Chinese feminism and female sexual desire, new sexual morality discourse and the great debate on love, the first and second waves of feminism, and queer theory. By tracing the development and changes in Chinese concepts of gender/sexuality from ancient times to the present day, this course aims to ensure that you can, while remaining rooted in history, refer to constructions of knowledge in Western gender/sexuality culture and theory and proceed to rethink and deepen the contemporary discussion on these topics on an individual and societal level.

Globalization implies escalated pace of free flow of people, capital, and ideas across political boundaries. While national framework still exercises constraint on those lacking resource to move, a signification portion of Chinese overseas demonstrates high transnational mobility. This course first reviews the concepts associated with globalization. Then it examines the extent to which the Chinese overseas have been globalized. It also studies the obstacles to and impacts on Chinese overseas in their efforts in the process of globalization.

This course focuses on the migration trajectories of Chinese leaving China and dispersed in many parts of the world. While it examines the formation and transformation of migrant-sending localities in the past and the present, and discusses the patterns of migration as well as the networks that facilitated Chinese migration, the central purpose of the course is analyze and evaluate the perspectives and methods used by scholars to understand Chinese migration. This course thus is suitable for students interested in the Chinese overseas and in methodology. The training you acquire in this course would provide you with a foundation to pursue courses focusing on the global diaspora and on theories.

This is a comprehensive introduction to medieval English literature, with a focus on the Middle English period. Middle English literature embraces an astonishing variety of genres and subjects, from the aggressive debate of 'The Owl and the Nightingale' to the painful tragedy (and some comedy) of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic "Age of Faith" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages.

Selected texts will be read in Middle English with the help of a glossary; no experience reading Old or Middle English is required.

Victorian Literature introduces a selection of literary works from the nineteenth century, while drawing attention to neglected aspects of this extremely versatile, fast changing, and intriguingly self-conscious age. The course aims to foster excitement about the indeterminacies, doubts, and fissures that shaped the Victorian period's greatest cultural achievements. At the same time, we shall critically reconsider the many legacies of the shifts it saw in epistemological, cultural, and specifically literary conceptualisations.

This module provides an overview of the most important works, themes, and concerns of the Victorian age, one of the most prolific periods of English literature. You will learn how to analyze, discuss, and write criticism about canonical texts and the popular culture of the time. You will also be encouraged to evaluate critically your attitudes and responses to "the Victorians".

This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer.

Issues raised by this course include, but are not confined to:

	the structural constitution of war
	the differences and similarities between war and violence
	the inherent ambivalence of war
	semantics, rhetorics and discourse of war
	artistic expression of war experience as ambiguating gesture

In this module we will be focusing on literature produced in response to the historical experience of Empire. We will look at the way in which literary narratives have been used to legitimize the imperial project - justifying its `civilizing mission', reinforcing certain racial stereotypes and hierarchies, and contributing to an archive of knowledge on colonial subjects and territories. However this complicity between literature and Empire is only part of the story. We will also be exploring the ambivalence that so often haunts the peripheries of imperial narratives, and examining the way in which literature has served to critique colonial ideologies and practices. Our discussion will be wide-ranging, both historically and geographically. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will also include analyses of Herge's

As we read we will consider the formulization of an "American" "Early" "Literature". Whatconstitutes "America" before 1789? Are these texts "literary"? Does our study of these texts require a teleological perspective? What factors determined the canonization of only English language texts from a multi-lingual, multi-colonial, and native population? How has pre-revolutionary America been represented in the past and in our own time? How do these 'secondary' histories determine what of the past gets preserved, celebrated, and canonized? What aspects of early America are forgotten in this process? What can we learn about contemporary American culture from these imaginative representations?

This course analyzes and interprets American culture mostly from the first half of the twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, and film, looking at the way that the conditions of modernity engendered new forms that go beyond the earlier novel/romance dichotomy. We'll study realism (Cather); naturalism in its classic, modernist, and Depression-era forms (London, Stein, Steinbeck, respectively); as well as classic modernists Eliot, Hemingway, and West, examining their experiments involving perspective, language, history, memory, and the surreal. We'll study the dark filmic vision of film noir, focusing on patterns of corrupt morality, cold passion, and dehumanizing modernity. The short fiction of the Southern Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor will be discussed in terms of the grotesque and the cultural division of country and city. We'll read Naked Lunch, Burroughs' shockingly experimental work examining power and addiction. We'll conclude with a novel by Robinson that evokes a hybrid world of nature and domesticity through non-hierarchical, non-individualized discourse.

Through the interpretation and study of selected works of American literature and culture from 1945 to the present, we will consider the ways that writers respond to changes in the economic, political, and social conditions of the United States during the postmodern era. While some writers reassert long-standing themes such as the individual's quest for freedom defined against the constrictions of status-quo, domestic life (Kerouac, Ginsberg, Morrison, the Confessional Poets), others pose intellectual questions about language and meaning through metafictional innovation (Nabokov, Vonnegut, Barth) or confront national myths such as the American Dream (Dylan, Mamet) and the romance of the Western frontier (McCarthy). In an age where mass culture has replaced intellectual literacy, contemporary American authors ponder the place of the novelist in the world (DeLillo), reflect on the meaning of ethnic identity (Walker), and seek out a critical perspective from which to view the present

This module explores a diverse range of African literatures -  including works from Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa. It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

Introduction to Publishing is taught by guest instructors from the field of publishing.  It will introduce you to the economic, legal, and social factors that influence which texts are published and how those texts circulate.  You will consider publishing from a range of perspectives, including authors, editors, and the publishers themselves, and think about the role of publishing in disseminating culture and information.

This course combines theoretical and practical approaches.  You will learn how literary productions are shaped by figures and forces beyond the author.  You will also consider how the skills you learn as English students relate to various roles in the field of publishing, whether as an author, an editor, a publicist, or a marketing professional.

Although this course will consider a range of different types of publishing, it will pay specific attention to contemporary Singapore.

If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature.
This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature.

Martin Esslin coined Theatre of the Absurd to group together a substantial number of post-World
War II dramatic works that questioned realism and challenged the conventional dramatic form.'
There was no Absurdist movement, and most playwrights whom we consider Absurdists did not
identify themselves as such. Nevertheless, the designation is useful to begin thinking about their	shared concern for what it means to be human in a time of social and political upheaval. You will be provoked to consider this central question as you learn more about the playwrights' dramatizations of habit, time, humour and suffering. The course will train you to close read Absurdist plays, and develop an appreciation for theirI destabilising effects on actors and the audience member. By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to differentiate between the social, historical,philosophical factors that affect the writing and production of absurdist drama. The seminar format will facilitate discussions as	 you share your reading, viewing, and performance/staging experiences with the class.

Course Content
The discomfort and frustration evoked by the Theatre of the Absurd force character(s) and the
audience to confront the question, "What does it mean to be human?" Each week, we will look	closely at one play, and if a recording of a production is available, we will view snippets in class to give you an idea of how each play could be staged. You will also perform scenes from the play in	1, class. The course will provoke you to consider what it means to be human as we look closely at absurdist portrayals of habit, time, humour and suffering.

Who was King Arthur, and how did he evolve into the household name that he is today? Where did the legends of his knights originate, and how did they develop over time? How widespread were the Arthurian legends across medieval Europe, and what made them so appealing to authors of English literature in more recent centuries? These are some of the questions to be explored on this module, which surveys the long development of several of the major narratives involving King Arthur and his knights, stretching from their medieval origins to modern literary adaptations. The first half of the module focusses on medieval texts, all of which will be studied in translation. You will gain an understanding of the generic, stylistic and thematic individuality of these medieval texts, as well as an awareness of the ways in which each text reflects the composer's explorations of the fundamental moral questions underpinning themes such as chivalric heroism and romantic love. The second half of the module turns towards modern reception, and here you will explore the changing significance and reimaginations of the Arthurian tradition in the nearer past. As Arthurian adaptations and reinventions continue to be produced and to occupy the public consciousness in the twenty-first century, this module seeks to offer you a sense of the enduring qualities of the legends of the `once and future king'.

What makes a poem Romantic? Does it have something to do with the style in which it is written? Is it a question of content or mood? Or can we use 'Romantic' to simply categorise poems written between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries? Focussing primarily on verse, students will examine a rich range of texts labelled 'Romantic', reflecting on what it means to read, sound out, listen to, and critically interpret poetry of the period. The course combines close reading with contextual analysis, giving students the opportunity to develop their understanding of poetic forms and devices while exploring works in their aesthetic, cultural, and political milieu. It also draws together current research in the fields of Romantic studies and poetics with literary criticism published during the period, by writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Throughout the semester, students will consider how poems on the syllabus were experienced by Romantic audiences, using the William Blake Archive to access high-resolution reproductions of Blake's illuminated books and the Princeton Prosody Archive to access late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century guidelines for reading poetry aloud.

In the first three novels (by Syal, Ali and Mo respectively), we will look at how writers depict double-consciousness, how they negotiate subject positions within and between different socio-cultural traditions/formations. With the last two novels (by Gunesekera and Gupta respectively), we will engage definitional concerns, that is, we will look at how writers try to escape the perennial absorptionism versus enclavism debate that constrains 'minority writing.'

Identifying a series of critical concepts essential to the conceptualization  and production of early children's literature (among them easiness, gradation, and abridgment), we will consider how eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers have sought to convey challenging themes to young audiences as comprehensi bly, appealingly, and, at times, intensively as possible. How is the threat of child mortality treated in the New-England Primer's rhyming alphabet (1727) and Christina Rossetti's verse parable Goblin Market (1862)? How do Isaac Watts and George MacDonald respond differently to the challenge of introducing young readers to Christian theology? What taxonomic comparisons  might we locate between John Newbery's eighteenth-century compendiums and Victorian children's magazine? This course will also develop students' skills in using archival databases such as Eighteenth-Centurey Collections Online and Nineteenth-Century Collections Online.

In this course, we regard the `human' as (1) an evolving concept and (2) a lived experience.  As a concept, we trace the theoretical understanding of the human from humanism, transhumanism to posthumanism.  As a lived reality, we consider our place in the shifting relations between the human, the nonhuman and our environments. 

By close reading selected films, literary works and critical writings, we will explore encounters between the humanities and the sciences to rethink our relationship with our immediate reality. Our central question is: What does it mean to be human in the face of rapid technological advances, digitalization, climate change and the destruction of biodiversity?

You will develop a comprehensive understanding of the textual and theoretical issues raised in the course, and will develop appropriate analytical skills in the process. More specifically, this module teaches you the skills and vocabulary required to respond to an array of postmodern literary and filmic texts. You will learn how to analyze and evaluate a diverse range of literary forms and genres, relevance to the period. Special attention will be focused on the manner in which grand narratives are relativized and students will learn to independently assess various completing arguments, whilst developing your research skills. The course will also require you to engage with critical theorists of the period, including the work of key theorists such as Patricia Waugh, Brian McHale, Linda Hutcheon, and others.

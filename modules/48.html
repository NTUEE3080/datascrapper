This course introduces you to the basic principles of genetics at the molecular level. After discussing the structure-function relationship of DNA and the genetic code, we will examine how DNA is organized within living cells and how it is segregated during cell division, and the increasingly relevant question of epigenetic modifications of DNA. The important roles of genes in developmental processes, and in basic human and medical genetics are discussed at an introductory level. Whenever possible, topics will be highlighted through the presentation of key experiments and the most recent results not yet included in textbooks. You will make use of the principles covered in this course throughout the rest of your Biology degree, and it forms an important basis for most life sciences-related professions.

This course will introduce the concepts of basic molecular and cell biology with emphasis on eukaryotic cells and the use of recombinant DNA methodologies to address molecular mechanisms. The course begins by looking at DNA as the carrier of genetic information and how the genetic code is used to produce proteins which carry out most of the reactions in the cell. You will be introduced to restriction enzymes and ligase ? the cornerstones of recombinant methodology. We will also explore how the cell is organized into compartments, how proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm are targeted to the various compartments, how the cell maintains its shape and size through the cytoskeleton, how cell moves and how the cell divides to produce daughter cells. Key experiments and researchers? contributions will be highlighted to inspire students. Tutorials will be used to clarify doubts and strengthen understanding.

Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving process that can be used to develop solutions for a wide range of problems across various disciplines, including math, science, engineering, business, finance and humanities. The aim of this course is to take you from having no prior experience of thinking in a computational manner to a point where you can apply abstraction, decomposition and algorithm design to solve some basic problems in sciences. In addition, the course will include topics to raise awareness of the socio-ethical issues arising from the pervasiveness of computing technology and impending trends.

This course aims to provide you with the general knowledge and basic training of mathematics in biology. In this course, you will go back to the early days of biological research to recognize that some great discoveries in biology were possible only through application of mathematics. Additionally, you will study a few biological phenomena that most of you are familiar with, such as Mendelian genetics, population genetics, gene mapping, bacterial mutation, and enzyme catalysis. During the online course, you will learn how to 'translate' a biological problem into 'mathematical language' called an equation. Then you solve the equation by using mathematical tools and arrive at a 'solution' which is one of the equations of life. Finally, you will apply the equation to life situation to test whether the equation has been able to unravel the mystery that you were concerned with at the beginning.

Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

It also aims to enable students to critically assess the civic institutions that structure their local and global communities. To these ends, the course will examine the nature of ethics, its understanding across different cultures, and how it is manifested in concepts, social structures, and governance institutions. Topics to be explored include human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, inequality, and sexuality. The rights and duties of citizenship shall be a unifying theme. Students will think through assumptions they hold on all of these matters. They will be provided with the tools to understand various and even contradictory perspectives on these important issues.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

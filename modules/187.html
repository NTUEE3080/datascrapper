The course covers fundamental concepts and organizing principles of physical chemistry that provide the basis for many aspects of chemistry and related fields, including analytical, inorganic, organic and bio-related chemistry. It will bring everyone to the same level of command of basic physical chemistry that is essential to progress to higher levels of core physical chemistry courses. Coupled with mathematical models, physical chemistry can provide quantitative results to compare with and understand experiments, and sometimes to stimulate new experiments. The concepts espoused in the course will be illustrated and connected with real world applications. Practical work is at the heart of chemistry. The laboratory component of the course therefore aims to expose you to chosen experiments which are meant to further consolidate the theoretical aspects learned during the course. The aim is to train you to apply the principles of thermodynamics, kinetics and spectroscopy presented in the lecture courses, in some illustrative experiments. This will help you gain familiarity with a variety of physico-chemical measurement techniques and instill in you the ability to work independently as well as part of a team.

This is an introductory course designed to provide you with a broad understanding of the physical environments in Singapore. You will learn about how Earth Systems have affected the physical environment of Singapore over time. The emphasis will be on the natural physical processes by which these environments form, evolve and interact dynamically in the Earth Systems as part of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and anthrosphere . Since Earth Systems Science is
interdisciplinary by nature, we will use multi-scientific disciplines, especially geology, chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics. Emphasis w ill be placed on examining the various environments in the field and through exploratory laboratory exercises. The material covered in this course will provide a strong basis for understanding and evaluating potential changes to Singapore's environment in the future.

Environmental issues have entered the centre of international politics and global governance in the recent two decades. This course is to introduce global environmental politics and governance (actors, institutions, mechanisms, norms and power dynamics) to students, and examine the topic by a typology of three categories: global common pool resource, transboundary environmental disputes, and local accumulative environmental change. The course encourages and mentors student?s independent research and critical thinking beyond readings and classroom discussion by assigning them into groups and conduct in-depth case studies, taking them to visit an environmental organization with global outreach and impact, and guiding them to incorporate first-hand observation into systemic learning. Via multiple learning sources and innovative teaching methods, the course aims at opening a compound, dynamic and interdisciplinary field to the students.

The means by which living things put together or break down complex molecules and derive energy will be the foundation for the course. Some of these processes will be universal whilst others may be specific to plants, animals or subsets thereof. Movement, transport, and signaling will be added to the basic physiological framework.  Adaptations to variations in environment will segue into physiological ecology, which will integrate all course content in the context of nature?s laboratory ? complex ecosystems.

Power is the defining feature of international politics and security. As such, international relations scholars focus on great power-led regional institutions, such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), for their research, because those institutions possess 'power' in shaping international politics. However, there are so many other regional political/security institutions in the world, which begs an important question: what kind of power do regional security institutions that are not led by great powers have? This seminar aims to understand material and non-material power of non-great power-led regional institutions possess in shaping international and regional politics. To this end, the seminar offers you the in-depth knowledge of non-great power-led regional security institutions in the world, ranging from Asia to the Middle East to Latin America to South America. More specifically, the seminar explores their institutional history, objectives, and functions, exploring the applicability of the existing theoretical frameworks in the IR field. This seminar is geared toward those who are interested in secondary powers in international politics and security institutions.

A study of democracy cannot take place without analyzing political parties and elections. Political parties, in the West at least, have contributed enormously to the flourishing and stability of democracy. Parties link the state and society, take part in elections and contribute towards the structuring (and re-structuring) of political processes and institutions. Yet, the nature of political parties differ throughout time and space; similarly, the nature of elections differ throughout democracies - there is significant diversity in the way the electoral systems are structured, the legislations governing elections, the frequency of elections, the way campaigns are conducted, inter alia. As such, there is a need to understand the differing types of parties and elections, the impact that they have on society and political systems, who runs in elections, how voters make their choices, and the threats to our existing understandings of democracy and elections.
This module studies the development of political parties and electoral systems, emphasizing the analytical component (how and why) in addition to the standard descriptive approach (what).

Qualitative research is an essential tool for deeper probing of diverse social phenomena and for designing effective public management strategies and policies. In the public administration and policy areas, narratives, case studies, observations, and more recently, focus groups have contributed insight and depth to our understanding of the structural, managerial, and environmental factors embedded in the public sector. Given this, you, as an independent researcher, need to understand the philosophy of qualitative, non-statistical social science research, focusing on how to design methods of qualitative research and how to conduct the analysis. The main objective of this course is not only to empower you to critically consume research through various forms of qualitative methods, but also to provide the fundamental skills for their own future rigorous research work (e.g., final year project). More specifically, while studying different qualitative inquiry approaches, you will be able to create a rationale for a qualitative inquiry that will be applicable to their research (or a hypothetical one) and to conduct qualitative research with data production (e.g., interviews, case studies, and observations). Lastly, you will be able to analyze and interpret their data using content or another discourse analytic technique. This course is organized along the following themes: (1) introduction of qualitative research, (2) research proposal outline, (3) developing and designing qualitative research, (4) observation studies, (5) interviews, (6) discourse and narrative research, (7) analysis of verbal data, (8) video data analysis, (9) case study, (10) content analysis, and (11) mixed methods.

You will learn various empirical methods for policy evaluation to measure the causal effects of policies. This include regression, matching based on observables, difference-in-difference, instrumental variable, regression discontinuity design. You will work with real world data and replicate policy evaluations using these methods using STATA (statistical software). Finally, you will also learn how to conduct spatial analysis, learning how to collect and extract data across space, and create maps.

This course will introduce you to the politics and policies of food in several countries, international organisations, and across time. Food is fundamentally essential to our physical existence, but it is also intensely cultural, with socially constructed behaviour and preferences that are change-resistant even in the presence of new knowledge, policies, and practices. How have different historical, social, economic, political, and institutional factors contributed to shaping national and international food policy outcomes? In this course, we begin with a heuristic analytical framework that enables you to study how interests, ideas, instruments, and institutions interact and affect the formation, development, and implementation of national and international food policy decisions. This course is organised around four themes: politics of food identity; globalisation or glocalisation; politics of food scandals; and international politics of food. By taking this course, you will learn how food is a powerful lens to understand contemporary politics and policies beyond consumption and nutrition.

'Power' is the most important, defining concept in international politics. Nevertheless, it has yet to be consensual definitions among scholars. This seminar aims to offer students the in-depth, comprehensive knowledge of the concept of 'power'. Through class discussions, students will learn the historiography of the concept, the debates over the concept in the International Relations field, the subfield of power (e.g. material and ideational power), and its operationalization and measurements. Applying these conceptual frameworks, you will analyze how the ongoing and past power transitions have shaped international politics. This course is more relevant for those who are interested in graduate studies in International Relations.

This course aims to develop your understanding of key concepts, frameworks and theories of public health and politics that are essential for analyzing the causes and consequences of disease outbreaks, the performance of governments worldwide in handling disease outbreaks or combating pandemics, and other key issues related to disease outbreaks (e.g. inequality, stigma, injustice). In addition, it aims to develop your reflective capacity and enable you to link theory to practice through examining case studies in different countries. This course is for students who want to develop and strengthen their knowledge and skills for analyzing public health and related issues. It is also for students who want to pursue careers in the public sector or in the field of healthcare.

Political theorists are increasingly turning to film as a repository of political insight that reflects fundamental facts about society and culture. This course will focus, however, less on the explicit political representations presented within specific films (for example, as in the narrative communication of already formed ideological visions of the world), in order to investigate the capacity of film to itself generate unique philosophical and political orientations via its singular form.   Through reading the contributions of contemporary theorists such as Alain Badiou, Jacques Ranciere, William Connolly, Davide Panagia, Joshua Foa Dienstag, Michael Shapiro, and others, we will investigate such diverse topics as film's relation to democratic thinking, the connection between cinematic and political representation, the political economy of film production, and film's embodiment of thinking the event. In addition, we will also examine a select group of particular film genres - specifically the Western, the horror, and the film noir - in order to understand what particular insights they communicate about contemporary political life.

This course simulates the work of the United Nations Security Council using a series of crisis simulations. Through the 'representation' of a country in simulations of the UN Security Council, you will develop skills in public speaking, research, and negotiation. In each simulation, you will research your country's position on a crisis facing the international community and then draft, debate, negotiate, and vote on resolutions to address those issues. Any student interested in pursuing a career in statecraft and diplomacy would benefit from this class.

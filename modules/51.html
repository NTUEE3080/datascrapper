This course aims to provide you with the general knowledge and basic training of mathematics in biology. In this course, you will go back to the early days of biological research to recognize that some great discoveries in biology were possible only through application of mathematics. Additionally, you will study a few biological phenomena that most of you are familiar with, such as Mendelian genetics, population genetics, gene mapping, bacterial mutation, and enzyme catalysis. During the online course, you will learn how to 'translate' a biological problem into 'mathematical language' called an equation. Then you solve the equation by using mathematical tools and arrive at a 'solution' which is one of the equations of life. Finally, you will apply the equation to life situation to test whether the equation has been able to unravel the mystery that you were concerned with at the beginning.

This course is designed to bring you from the basic fundamental concepts of genetics to current understanding of molecular genetics. In particular, this course will bring broader understanding of the genetic elements beyond the 'classical genetic dogmas', genetic concepts beyond the Mendelian laws and breadth of genetic information beyond single gene approaches. Moreover it will introduce modern genetic concepts and technologies including genome-based studies, large-scale genetics to understand human health and disease.

This course aims to introduce basic concepts in immunology and engage students to work on open questions/ unresolved problems in immunology. You will learn fundamentals of the immune system including immune cells, their functions and distributions as well as molecular and cellular components of innate immunity and adaptive immunity. In order to properly understand immunological data, you will also learn how to analyze flow cytometry example data files using appropriate software. To further develop your critical thinking skills in the context of immunological research, you are expected to read and interpret original research publications and perform extensive literature search on selected topics in immunology. Upon completing the course, you are required to submit an individual final report discussing current health issues and solutions. In this way, you are encouraged to utilize the knowledge you have acquired throughout your studies, instead of just memorizing facts. This course should help you to understand immunological concepts and identify open questions, then develop some of the problem solving skills required for a career in research and other types of creative jobs.

This course aims to provide fundamental knowledge about how practical techniques in molecular and cell biology methods may be evolved and developed into current commercial products. These include techniques related to protein and DNA/RNA, microscope imaging, molecular cloning and cell culture. This commercial-concept based course will develop your curiosity about how biological processes are implemented into final products and commercial business. In some special case studies, financial funding history or product regulation highlights will be introduced as inspiration to shape up potential business ideas later.

This one-week course aims to introduce students to the taxonomic and molecular techniques utilized as a part of the toolkit of the modern botanist. This course includes lectures, a field trip and laboratory experiments, all of which will be held at the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG). Through the field trip, you will learn how a plant taxonomist uses morphological characters to classify species. For the laboratory aspect, you will learn how to perform DNA extraction and preparation of DNA libraries for high throughput sequencing. You will then assemble DNA markers to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree and, in combination with data on morphological traits, interpret your results and form conclusions regarding phylogenetic relationships between the species of interest.

This 13-week programme provides a complete and concise treatment of the key considerations in Good Manufacturing Practice for medical devices. The main area of concentration is in the United States (US) Quality System Regulation (QSR), which has influenced much of how quality systems are managed today including the ISO13485. The course presents the US QSR in detail giving examples on how to apply each requirement. You will understand how to construct quality documentation for medical device manufacturing. The second part of this course teaches three essential sterilisation methods commonly used in the medical device industry. These are steam, ethylene oxide and radiation sterilisation, including the vital aspects of sterilisation validation mandated by regulatory and quality system requirements. You will be required to perform casework to test your ability to apply these concepts in real scenarios

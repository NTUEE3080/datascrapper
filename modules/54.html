This course aims to provide you with the general knowledge and basic training of mathematics in biology. In this course, you will go back to the early days of biological research to recognize that some great discoveries in biology were possible only through application of mathematics. Additionally, you will study a few biological phenomena that most of you are familiar with, such as Mendelian genetics, population genetics, gene mapping, bacterial mutation, and enzyme catalysis. During the online course, you will learn how to 'translate' a biological problem into 'mathematical language' called an equation. Then you solve the equation by using mathematical tools and arrive at a 'solution' which is one of the equations of life. Finally, you will apply the equation to life situation to test whether the equation has been able to unravel the mystery that you were concerned with at the beginning.

In this course, we will learn to use biophysical techniques to find out information about different types of proteins, in terms of concentration, secondary structure, oligomeric state, reconstitution systems using both detergent and lipid, purity, function and inhibition. 

The students will be provided with a set of initial problems to solve. To solve these problems, a hands-on approach will adopted that will make use of a range of different biophysical techniques. Each of these techniques will provide different types of information about the samples. An important aspect that will be emphasized is to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and to be able to design experiments knowing which techniques should be used first, and which last. 

Each daily session will consist of two parts (morning and afternoon). Each part will start will a 30 min briefing and will end up with a collation of results session and discussion. All days will have associated a pre-recorded video lecture for support, but a live 30 minute briefing will precede all sessions. 
In the first part we will look at ways to determine protein concentration using visible and UV light, and to measure the size of larger particles such as liposomes or detergent micelles using dynamic light scattering. 
The second part will look at how to obtain secondary structure information to assess proper folding, from infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism.  
The third part of the course will focus on size and oligomerization of molecules, and how this can be determined. To do this, we will use standard centrifugation techniques and also analytical ultracentrifugation (velocity and sedimentation).    
The fourth part will look at function, using kast kinetics (stopped flow), fluorescence and channel activity in model lipid bilayers. Inhibition by small molecules will be tested and dose response plots will be used to determine the affinity of the drugs.

Psychologists have long studied the human condition in its many manifestations of weaknesses, damages and maladaptive behaviors. Yet, the discipline of psychology must also understand and appreciate the character, strengths and virtues of human life, including those relevant to the concepts of happiness, hope, motivation, mindfulness, resilience, gratitude and compassion, all of which enable individuals to thrive and flourish, while contributing to the health and well-being of family and society. This course provides a review of the literature, research, methodology and experiential practice of Positive Psychology, as well as their applications toward personal growth and social betterment.

Does the language we speak influence other aspects of cognition and perception? This class will introduce you to the Whorfian Hypothesis about the relationship between language and thought, and how to conduct experimental tests using the neo-Whorfian approach and techniques from psycholinguistics. In the first half of the class, you will take part in a number of quick-fire experiments, to build up an experimental `tool kit' of techniques. We will review current evidence about the influence of different linguistic features on different domains of cognition and perception (e.g., categorization, spatial cognition, numerical cognition, colour perception, audition, and cross-modal perception). For each domain, we will investigate how the published literature relates to language in Singapore, and identify gaps in the existing literature. Interactions between language and the mind in extreme scenarios (e.g., language deprivation) will also be addressed. In the second half of the course, you will identify a research gap, formulate detailed a hypothesis, preregister a study, and conduct a data collection exercise for presentation in the class Symposium - a poster session held in the final week of term. The lab-based class provides an in-depth experience of the research cycle from identification of knowledge gaps to hypothesis formation, data collection and research presentation, with a focus on 21st century research skills such as power analysis &amp; preregistration. This class will provide valuable insights for students with an interest in cross-cultural differences, psycholinguistics, education, or philosophy of mind. Students planning on conducting psychological research in the future will benefit from hands on experience of current best practice in the research cycle.

The purpose of this professional applied module is to provide you as student with an introduction to the forensic psychology of crime and terrorism. 

This course will benefit you if you have an interest in working with the police, prisons, military security, probations, child protection, the courts and community forensic psychology as a psychologist, counsellor, case manager or a law enforcer or safety officer. 

The slant of this course will be towards forensic-law enforcement, rather than forensic-clinical or forensic-mental health issues. This means that the focus on crime-mental health issues will be limited, and there will be a focus on law enforcement and crime prevention, investigation, crime profiling and analysis. 

This course will provide you with a realistic preview of the work of a psychologist working in applied forensic law enforcement contexts, because there will be a field visit and a talk by a law enforcement professional. Actual Singaporean and international case studies will be presented. Projects will be based on real-world problems and solutions that will also require practical considerations (e.g. budgeting, planning, and so on in addition to crime prevention factors). 

For those intending to become professional law enforcers (e.g. police or prisons officers), this course will provide you with the theoretical and conceptual foundations relating to crime analysis and crime prevention.

The aim of this course is to outline how best available research is integrated with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture and preference to achieve evidence-based practice in clinical psychology. The course covers empirically supported treatments (cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic) for major problem areas (depression, personality disorders, neuropsychological impairment) and examines elements of effective therapy relationships (empathy, working alliance, collecting patient feedback) as well as effective methods of adapting treatment to the individual patient (reactance/resistance level, preferences, culture, religion and spirituality). This course aims to encourage a critical stance when considering the empirical status of treatment models and their clinical applications and provides hands-on experience in adopting elements of a therapeutic relationship.

The aim of this course is to equip students with an understanding of the application of psychology in a correctional setting. Students will be instructed on the causes and motivations behind offending behaviour. This would help students to identify factors associated with offending behaviour, in order that these factors can be elicited in assessment and addressed in intervention. Emphasis will be placed on how specific offender populations (sex offenders, violent offenders, drug offenders, juvenile offenders, women offenders) are assessed, and how intervention principles and strategies are adapted to address specific concerns by these groups. This course aims to encourage students to adopt a scientist-practitioner approach in offender rehabilitation, by considering evidence-based research to influence applied practice.

This course examines community-based approaches and interventions for promoting community well-being as well as preventing and managing mental health illnesses. The course covers exciting, innovative approaches such as low intensity psychotherapeutic interventions, telemedicine, and promoting mental health messages through new approaches (e.g., social media) - efforts aiming at plugging gaps in services that have traditionally focused on treating more clinically significant illnesses. There will be discussions on emerging research that examines the implementation and outcomes of community mental health programmes and the controversies and challenges in-down-scaling psychological interventions to new settings where they are administered by professionals not traditionally trained in the specialization of psychology. Issues relating to the current state of mental health in Singapore and efforts to improve it will be touched on. Students will be encouraged to apply lessons learned to the Singapore context.

This applied module aims to introduce you to the theories and practices of Industrial and Organisational Psychology (Occupational Psychology) as applied to individuals at work and to organisations. Students who have an interest in applying psychology to work settings will be exposed to a scope of topics that are relevant to the practice in both private and public sectors. 
 
The course aims to develop students? theoretical understanding as well as knowledge of the practical tools and solutions that are applied in the IO practice. The contextual learning is to help students understand the consulting cycle and stakeholder engagements unique to the IO practice. The intention is to provide the students a fairly comprehensive primer to what they may expect in further education and a career in the IO specialisation. 
 
The course will have a strong emphasis on applied skills. Each seminar will be structured such that students are exposed less to the theories of I/O Psychology and more to how they are practiced within organisations. This will include exposure to best guidelines as set by standard-setting bodies, commercial products and solutions commonly used in industry, and case studies to discuss the ethics of psychological societies of different nations.

Recent discoveries have overturned longstanding beliefs that the neurophysiology of the brain remains relatively fixed after childhood.  We will discuss new research that compares and contrasts both adult and child neural cognitive neuroplasticity.  For example, it is now known that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, and that areas of the brain formally devoted to one modality can be quickly recruited for processing a second modality when circumstances require. This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning.  We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints. In particular, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ?brain training? programs.

We begin with a brief, non-technical, conceptual introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications, suitable for students from any field. Then we focus on preparing you to participate in the global debates about the legal, policy and ethics issues that Al is already creating for humans. Among the questions considered: With AI tracking your every move on social media, what privacy protections do you have? Who is liable if an AI learns human biases and makes a racist hiring recommendation?  When our minds can be uploaded to computers, will they have legal rights? Is a self-driving car liable for killing a pedestrian? Should autonomous weapons be allowed to decide to kill a human? We compare possible answers in Singapore and American law and learn how informed citizens everywhere can shape AI's future.

The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

This course focuses on issues central to the phenomenon of bilingualism. It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world's population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

In this course, we will look at how language is used to construct taken-for-granted stories, metaphors and ideologies that perpetuate environmentally harmful modes of human existence. We'll take an eco-critical perspective and develop an analytical toolkit that we'll apply to various discourses, including those referred to as `environmentalist'. We will analyze a wide range of texts (pieces of journalistic, academic and policy writing, excerpts from textbooks, advertisements, mission statements and `about us' sections of various companies and corporations, examples of `green initiatives' and environmentalist campaigning, blogs, literary narratives and poetry), and unpack the main tropes, frames and strategies through which environmentally hazardous discourses become normalized. We will also look for the alternatives that promote ecological harmony. Our major topics include but are not limited to: development, growth, progress, climate change, animal rights, nature-as-resource, individualism, consumerism, culturally constructed images of the ideal body and food consumption. The course will provide a stimulating environment for you to enhance your critical thinking skills and acquire concepts that will serve you well in many prospective careers, especially in industries with environmental and sustainability concerns. And those are many.

Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

Anthropological linguistics is an interdisciplinary sub-field of linguistics and anthropology that examines the link between language and culture, and they ways they influence each other. It is concerned with the role of language and meaning in their social and cultural contexts, and how they contribute to creating and perpetuating social structures and cultural practices.

This interdisciplinary course provides you with a theoretical and practical training in researching language and culture from an anthropological point of view. Though selected readings, class discussions, and first-hand experience in doing anthropological/linguistic fieldwork, at the conclusion of this course you will appreciate how the study of communicative practices in their cultural settings can reveal profound insights into the diverse ways that humans perceive and interpret their worlds.

This is an advanced course aimed at reexamining the understanding of human communication in the age of globalization. As a research agenda, the sociolinguistics of globalization represents a relatively new, but rapidly growing and vibrant interdisciplinary approach to the place and role of language in the contemporary flows of people, capital, ideas, world views, cultural artefacts and representations. Change, mobility, and flux have come to characterize contemporary social life and social imagination, and this course will be a forum for you to engage with the relevant readings that deal with these issues from a sociolinguistic perspective. Throughout the course, we will be examining conditions and themes that have come to occupy a prominent place in the sociolinguistic research program. We will identify what new theoretical and methodological notions we need to add to our `traditional' sociolinguistic repertoire to be able to scrutinize communication and emergent regimes of language in the contexts of superdiversity, spatial and symbolic mobility, globalized economic markets, tourism, war and terrorism.

This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved.

The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.

The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.

The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)
 
will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex
orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce
detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including
those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention
will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.

The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.

The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.

The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.

Key subjects covered include:
1.	using  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of
speech production and perception;
2.	the relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms
of speech production;
3.	an  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;
4.	an appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;
5.	practice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data.

This is an introductory module to provide an overview of the field of abnormal psychology.  The course discusses a variety of psychological conditions and human behaviors that are traditionally considered outside of what we see as 'normal.'  We will explore the major approaches to understanding these psychological disorders described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM; the most recent version is the fifth edition [DSM-5]), their manifestations, causes, risk factors, assessments, and treatments.  The course emphasizes the scientific and research aspects of abnormal psychology.  That is, it focuses on the knowledge obtained by rigorous scientific research methods.  At the end of this module, students should have an overall understanding of the various psychological disorders and be able to provide an account of abnormal behaviors and psychological disorders observed in daily life.  It is also the goal of this course that students achieve greater understanding and appreciation for the range of human behaviors.  In addition, this course provides a foundation for other more advanced courses that cover the understanding and treatment strategies for psychological disorders.  The knowledge learned in this course will serve as the foundation for related fields in health sciences, including clinical psychology, psychological counseling, social work, and rehabilitation.

Psychologists have long studied the human condition in its many manifestations of weaknesses, damages and maladaptive behaviors. Yet, the discipline of psychology must also understand and appreciate the character, strengths and virtues of human life, including those relevant to the concepts of happiness, hope, motivation, mindfulness, resilience, gratitude and compassion, all of which enable individuals to thrive and flourish, while contributing to the health and well-being of family and society. This course provides a review of the literature, research, methodology and experiential practice of Positive Psychology, as well as their applications toward personal growth and social betterment.

Does the language we speak influence other aspects of cognition and perception? This class will introduce you to the Whorfian Hypothesis about the relationship between language and thought, and how to conduct experimental tests using the neo-Whorfian approach and techniques from psycholinguistics. In the first half of the class, you will take part in a number of quick-fire experiments, to build up an experimental `tool kit' of techniques. We will review current evidence about the influence of different linguistic features on different domains of cognition and perception (e.g., categorization, spatial cognition, numerical cognition, colour perception, audition, and cross-modal perception). For each domain, we will investigate how the published literature relates to language in Singapore, and identify gaps in the existing literature. Interactions between language and the mind in extreme scenarios (e.g., language deprivation) will also be addressed. In the second half of the course, you will identify a research gap, formulate detailed a hypothesis, preregister a study, and conduct a data collection exercise for presentation in the class Symposium - a poster session held in the final week of term. The lab-based class provides an in-depth experience of the research cycle from identification of knowledge gaps to hypothesis formation, data collection and research presentation, with a focus on 21st century research skills such as power analysis &amp; preregistration. This class will provide valuable insights for students with an interest in cross-cultural differences, psycholinguistics, education, or philosophy of mind. Students planning on conducting psychological research in the future will benefit from hands on experience of current best practice in the research cycle.

The purpose of this professional applied module is to provide you as student with an introduction to the forensic psychology of crime and terrorism. 

This course will benefit you if you have an interest in working with the police, prisons, military security, probations, child protection, the courts and community forensic psychology as a psychologist, counsellor, case manager or a law enforcer or safety officer. 

The slant of this course will be towards forensic-law enforcement, rather than forensic-clinical or forensic-mental health issues. This means that the focus on crime-mental health issues will be limited, and there will be a focus on law enforcement and crime prevention, investigation, crime profiling and analysis. 

This course will provide you with a realistic preview of the work of a psychologist working in applied forensic law enforcement contexts, because there will be a field visit and a talk by a law enforcement professional. Actual Singaporean and international case studies will be presented. Projects will be based on real-world problems and solutions that will also require practical considerations (e.g. budgeting, planning, and so on in addition to crime prevention factors). 

For those intending to become professional law enforcers (e.g. police or prisons officers), this course will provide you with the theoretical and conceptual foundations relating to crime analysis and crime prevention.

The aim of this course is to outline how best available research is integrated with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture and preference to achieve evidence-based practice in clinical psychology. The course covers empirically supported treatments (cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic) for major problem areas (depression, personality disorders, neuropsychological impairment) and examines elements of effective therapy relationships (empathy, working alliance, collecting patient feedback) as well as effective methods of adapting treatment to the individual patient (reactance/resistance level, preferences, culture, religion and spirituality). This course aims to encourage a critical stance when considering the empirical status of treatment models and their clinical applications and provides hands-on experience in adopting elements of a therapeutic relationship.

The aim of this course is to equip students with an understanding of the application of psychology in a correctional setting. Students will be instructed on the causes and motivations behind offending behaviour. This would help students to identify factors associated with offending behaviour, in order that these factors can be elicited in assessment and addressed in intervention. Emphasis will be placed on how specific offender populations (sex offenders, violent offenders, drug offenders, juvenile offenders, women offenders) are assessed, and how intervention principles and strategies are adapted to address specific concerns by these groups. This course aims to encourage students to adopt a scientist-practitioner approach in offender rehabilitation, by considering evidence-based research to influence applied practice.

This course examines community-based approaches and interventions for promoting community well-being as well as preventing and managing mental health illnesses. The course covers exciting, innovative approaches such as low intensity psychotherapeutic interventions, telemedicine, and promoting mental health messages through new approaches (e.g., social media) - efforts aiming at plugging gaps in services that have traditionally focused on treating more clinically significant illnesses. There will be discussions on emerging research that examines the implementation and outcomes of community mental health programmes and the controversies and challenges in-down-scaling psychological interventions to new settings where they are administered by professionals not traditionally trained in the specialization of psychology. Issues relating to the current state of mental health in Singapore and efforts to improve it will be touched on. Students will be encouraged to apply lessons learned to the Singapore context.

This applied module aims to introduce you to the theories and practices of Industrial and Organisational Psychology (Occupational Psychology) as applied to individuals at work and to organisations. Students who have an interest in applying psychology to work settings will be exposed to a scope of topics that are relevant to the practice in both private and public sectors. 
 
The course aims to develop students? theoretical understanding as well as knowledge of the practical tools and solutions that are applied in the IO practice. The contextual learning is to help students understand the consulting cycle and stakeholder engagements unique to the IO practice. The intention is to provide the students a fairly comprehensive primer to what they may expect in further education and a career in the IO specialisation. 
 
The course will have a strong emphasis on applied skills. Each seminar will be structured such that students are exposed less to the theories of I/O Psychology and more to how they are practiced within organisations. This will include exposure to best guidelines as set by standard-setting bodies, commercial products and solutions commonly used in industry, and case studies to discuss the ethics of psychological societies of different nations.

Recent discoveries have overturned longstanding beliefs that the neurophysiology of the brain remains relatively fixed after childhood.  We will discuss new research that compares and contrasts both adult and child neural cognitive neuroplasticity.  For example, it is now known that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, and that areas of the brain formally devoted to one modality can be quickly recruited for processing a second modality when circumstances require. This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning.  We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints. In particular, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ?brain training? programs.

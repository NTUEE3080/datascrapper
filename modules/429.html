This course will give an introduction into the principles behind food safety hazard and risk assessment as well as the different existing national and international systems for food safety, food control and food standard setting. It will provide background on the current approaches and systems in place and stimulate discussion on how these need to evolve to keep pace with new and novel food innovations whilst meeting the needs of industry and regulatory safety assessors. The increasing globalisation of the food trade, changing consumption patterns, the intensification of agriculture, increasing travel and tourism, and new types of production and manufacturing systems are just some of the trends that are having a serious impact on food production and food safety in many countries. At the same time, several existing and new food safety hazards are of increasing concern and new pathogens are frequently emerging and being transferred from animal to human populations, primarily through food. These new challenges need to be addressed are best dealt with in new safety and regulatory frameworks and approaches; these frameworks and their background will be explained and described. 
Major theoretical topics of the course include: 
1	Risk Analysis as the basis for food standards 
2	Risk Assessment - Chemical and Microbiological Hazards; integrated risks &amp; 'One Health'  
3	New/Novel ingredient/food assessment
4	Safety by design concept  	 
5	HACCP - A standardized system for Hazard Control in food production

In this course, we adopt the overlapping-generations model as the dynamic model to model the macro economy, and use a consistent approach based on microeconomic foundations and the rationality of economic agents to address several issues in monetary policy, exchange-rate policy and fiscal policy. Among other issues, the issues in monetary policy studied here include the welfare effects of an increasing stock of fiat money, the development of financial intermediaries in the presence of differences in the rates of return between illiquid capital and money, and the reasons for the observed correlation between the nominal money stock and real output. The issues in exchange-rate policy studied here include the implications of different international monetary systems, the determination of exchange rates in the presence of currency controls and the indeterminacy of exchange rates when people are free to hold currencies of their choice.

1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains?

2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now.

3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.

All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies.

This course follows on from the module Fundamentals of IP to provide deeper knowledge and skills relating to some aspects of patent and registered design having substantial relevance in the engineering industry. 

The course provides you with the ability to identify aspects of patent and registered design law, understand how knowledge of patent and registered design law can drive an organization?s IP strategies, and assess potential courses of action concerning patentable inventions and design protection. Particular emphasis will be placed on the legal issues in relation to creation, protection, and exploitation of these intellectual assets. 

A note on the legal cases that are highlighted in the study units: these cases are for illustrative purposes in relation to the legal principles discussed; in general you are NOT expected to be able to recall them or use them in presenting arguments for assessment purposes.

This course provides you with a working understanding on engineering research and development and intellectual property (IP) in related context. It also trains you to apply and use IP knowledge to address real-life IP-related issues in the R&amp;D context. 

Key themes that will be covered are assessing IP issues related to R&amp;D, and the implementation and monitoring of suitable approaches to address these IP issues. Expanding on these, the course explores how an understanding of IP rights protection laws and their considerations can guide and support an organisation's R&amp;D activities and strategies. 

Particular emphasis will be placed on the practical and legal issues in relation to managing the R&amp;D value chain of creation/innovation, identification, ownership, protection, and commercial exploitation of intellectual assets. Case studies related to various branches of engineering including materials science engineering, will be presented and discussed.

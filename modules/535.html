Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The concept of business sustainability comprises three pillars: economic, environmental and social (Human &amp; Labor) - also known as people, planet and profits. (Investopedia https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp_). The focus recently (including by regulators) has added a fourth pillar - governance (anti-bribery and corruption). Organizations in the pursuit of profit have been implicated in a number of scandals involving bribery &amp; corruption, fraud, labour and human rights abuses, and environmental degradation. What role does law and ethics play in holding companies and individuals responsible for such scandals? How can companies ensure that they pay attention to social, environmental and governance factors and remain profitable? How do individuals and organizations decide what is the right thing to do? This course will require students to understand broad business sustainability issues and to apply ethical reasoning processes to decision making.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success.

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts.

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development of skills for dealing with complex problems in general.

This course introduces you to cutting-edge concepts, frameworks and practices that are current in social entrepreneurship, as well as critical issues in business ethics as a knowledge foundation for analysing and practicing social entrepreneurship. The course considers how social entrepreneurship plays out in organizations ranging from conventional companies seeking to adopt corporate social responsibility practices to double-bottom-line businesses and social enterprises.
The course specifies strategic and implementation tensions inherent in aligning business and
social/environmental values, and provides frameworks with which to analyse and resolve the tensions at play.This course trains you into a quasi-expert of social entrepreneurship by enabling them to apply frameworks to making tough decisions in real business contexts.
The course includes four modules: strategic corporate social responsibility (SCSR); double-bottom-line business (DBL), social enterprise (SE) and business ethics (BE). It begins by analysing and making decisions on the cases of conventional companies conducting social innovation initiatives through SCSR and DBL. We will then move to explore the cases of social enterprises. You will observe both the common and distinctive challenges facing conventional companies and social enterprises. The modules of SCSR, DBL and SE will be followed by an Entrepreneur Panel where social entrepreneurs introduce their initiatives and engage in a highly interactive conversation with students. The course will finish by taking a look at business ethics theories and issues that provide analytical depth and clarification to your understanding of social entrepreneurship.

This course aims to provide a firm understanding of marketing and is designed for students who have chosen to specialise in disciplines other than business. As you may already know, a working knowledge of marketing is beneficial wherever your career takes you. We will discuss basic principles of marketing. However, the focus is on its application and how this understanding could potentially enhance your future performance in your chosen field. A hands-on approach is expected and activities have been incorporated to encourage observation and enhance analytical ability. The course will require you to analyse businesses, evaluate alternatives, collaborate with team members, lead discussions, present your analysis and propose recommendations on selected organisations.

The course will begin by discussing sustainable marketing in the global context. We continue with marketing strategy and customer value. This requires an understanding of the business environment and buyer behaviour. We then focus on the 4 P?s, namely product, price, place and promotion.

Communication with the market is an important activity for many businesses and organizations. It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.

The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives.

The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities.

Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

As the world becomes more and more complex, technical skills alone are insufficient for the needs of many jobs. To become an accomplished professional in today's workforce, you will need to understand how people behave at work, work well with others, and be able to manage people regardless of whether your job title has the word 'manager' in it! 

BU8601 is an introductory course for non-business undergraduates to help you understand, think and act like managers. Knowledge and skills gained from this course will help you in any situation where you need to manage yourself and other people. This includes other university courses, final year projects, internship experiences, and eventually your careers.

We live in an era of rapid globalization in which being able to communicate across cultures is imperative to our ability to function in a diverse workplace, city, and world. In order to develop a foundational level of cross-cultural competency, this course will guide students to learn about the ways people from different cultural backgrounds think, communicate, and behave based on the value systems, worldviews, and narratives that ground them. Utilizing research findings, real-life stories and simulated experiential learning, this course is designed to increase our awareness, knowledge and skills of our own cultural backgrounds and the social, cultural and historical context in which we live in and communicate with others across cultures. The goal is to help students become a competent communicator in culturally diverse work places and societies.

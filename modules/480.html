                This is the first of two introductory modules on Asian art offered in the undergraduate programme. This
                course presents in critical, social and historical context the range of artefacts and works of art from
                China, India and Japan, including pottery, ritual vessels and figurines. Also covered are some aspects
                of architecture, sculpture, painting and woodblock prints. The materials covered span an extensive
                timeline, from c2000BC until c1500AD. The course sets out to study selected topics by examining
                pertinent materials in some detail. In doing so the art is placed into context with religious,
                philosophical and cultural issues.

                This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It
                begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in
                20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and
                complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy
                over a range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and
                cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent
                research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a
                foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

                You will be introduced to diverse examples of early twentieth-century visual material, and the
                socio-political and historical contexts in which they were produced. Broadly chronological in approach,
                a number of historical movements (including, but not limited to, Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism,
                Futurism, Dada and Surrealism) will be explored alongside the work of individual artists. The influence
                of modernist thought and aesthetics upon different areas of artistic production will also be
                highlighted, as will the relationship between art and politics.

                Coursework assignments will include a class presentation of research, a paper written after a museum
                fieldtrip and two in-class quizzes.

                This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an
                introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New
                Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional
                forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural
                Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a
                strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well
                as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

                In this course you will explore the development of contemporary art across Southeast Asia from the 1970s
                to the present, contextualised within the region's complex socio-political history. Covering Singapore
                and countries beyond, visual forms of all media, including installation, performance, and video are
                examined to understand how artists from economically and politically diverse regional societies have
                produced pieces revealing transregionally-connected expressive approaches specific to Southeast Asia.
                Through artwork analysis, in tandem with critical reading of assigned texts, you will develop visual
                literacy of regional contemporary art (particularly its themes and audience-engaging methods), and
                access to the art historical debates that distinguish Southeast Asian contemporary art in the global
                contemporary art arena.

                historical contexts and in so doing allow you to explore art history through a variety of human beliefs.
                This will include, but is not limited to the rituals of worship, sacred spaces, divine objects, images
                of magic, illuminated manuscripts and so on. We will examine case studies that demonstrate how
                stained-glass windows tell us Biblical stories; ask what kind of secrets the faceless Venus of the Stone
                Age hides from us; suggest which tunes Islamic calligraphy `sings' to our eyes; analyze what Jocho's
                Amida Buddha has been telling us throughout the centuries, and much more. This course is open to all
                students from any academic background. Once completed you will have a deeper understanding of these
                concepts and they can provide the basis for further study in Art History and History.

                This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By
                comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to
                gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for
                a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the
                dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film
                forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts
                and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making
                projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

                This course considers the manner in which art responds to war, and the ways in which war and violence
                are appropriated in both aesthetic and critical discourse. We will examine the centrality of war to
                human and civilisational experience, and also consider the conditions of inevitability that bind human
                experience to a deep-seated violent impulse. Issues raised by this course include, but are not confined
                to:

                the structural constitution of war
                the differences and similarities between war and violence
                the inherent ambivalence of war

                and information.

                This course combines theoretical and practical approaches. You will learn how literary productions are
                shaped by figures and forces beyond the author. You will also consider how the skills you learn as
                English students relate to various roles in the field of publishing, whether as an author, an editor, a
                publicist, or a marketing professional.

                Although this course will consider a range of different types of publishing, it will pay specific
                attention to contemporary Singapore.

                Who was King Arthur, and how did he evolve into the household name that he is today? Where did the
                legends of his knights originate, and how did they develop over time? How widespread were the Arthurian
                legends across medieval Europe, and what made them so appealing to authors of English literature in more
                recent centuries? These are some of the questions to be explored on this module, which surveys the long
                development of several of the major narratives involving King Arthur and his knights, stretching from
                their medieval origins to modern literary adaptations. The first half of the module focusses on medieval
                texts, all of which will be studied in translation. You will gain an understanding of the generic,
                stylistic and thematic individuality of these medieval texts, as well as an awareness of the ways in
                which each text reflects the composer's explorations of the fundamental moral questions underpinning
                themes such as chivalric heroism and romantic love. The second half of the module turns towards modern
                reception, and here you will explore the changing significance and reimaginations of the Arthurian
                tradition in the nearer past. As Arthurian adaptations and reinventions continue to be produced and to
                occupy the public consciousness in the twenty-first century, this module seeks to offer you a sense of
                the enduring qualities of the legends of the `once and future king'.

                In this course, we regard the `human' as (1) an evolving concept and (2) a lived experience. As a
                concept, we trace the theoretical understanding of the human from humanism, transhumanism to
                posthumanism. As a lived reality, we consider our place in the shifting relations between the human, the
                nonhuman and our environments.

                By close reading selected films, literary works and critical writings, we will explore encounters
                between the humanities and the sciences to rethink our relationship with our immediate reality. Our
                central question is: What does it mean to be human in the face of rapid technological advances,
                digitalization, climate change and the destruction of biodiversity?

                This course will build on students` knowledge of the practice of history by introducing
                them to classic works of historiography and the theoretical approaches, which such
                works take. Each week the course will focus on one key work, which will be
                contextualised in terms of its contribution to a wider historical and theoretical debate.
                Approaches covered will include Marxist history, the Annales School, Historical
                Sociology, the history of Nationalism, Micro-history, The Cultural Turn, Gender history,
                Subaltern Studies, Post-Colonial Studies, the history of the Senses, and Oral history.

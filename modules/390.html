This course will introduce you to key consumer behavior concepts, thus equipping you - as current or future managers - with the knowledge to evaluate and design effective marketing
decisions. After the completion of this course, you should be able to understand the psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and choose between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products), how social and cultural environments (e.g., friends, family, and culture) influence
consumer behaviour, and how marketers can adapt and improve marketing campaigns/strategies to more effectively reach and influence the consumers. You will also learn to appreciate the relevance of consumer behaviour for marketers and policymakers.

As a result of the interconnected nature of the global economy we need to acknowledge the role that Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer relationships plays in marketing. The impact and prevalence of these relationships mean that they should be at the heart of firms' decision making. This course helps students understand the reality of the business markets and the tasks of managing the complex, multiple and overlapping relationships in which firms are enmeshed and on which they can rely for competitive success. It moves away from the traditional 4Ps (product, pricing, promotion and place) paradigm and take a more holistic and integrated approach in understanding marketing. In addition, a strong relational approach is used in opposite to a transactional view of marketing. Marketing is viewed in this course as the process of managing and optimizing relationships, networks and interactions.

Consumers today are bombarded with thousands of messages on a daily basis. Consumers are also more skeptical, more fragmented and more difficult to reach than before. To meet these challenges, it is increasingly important for companies to develop a coherent marketing communication strategy. Marketers also need to keep searching for new ways to communicate with the consumers and make sure that the messages about their brands are perceived by the target consumers as they originally intend. As you will learn in this course, integrated marketing communications (IMC) is one of the fundamental building block for a company's strategy and success.

Marketing Channel is one of the most important assets in the organization's overall marketing strategy in this era where there exists much congestion in the market for similar products. Organizations must reach their consumers effectively but then how should we approach them? Innovation can come from 'place' by focusing on 'How do my customers want to buy?'  

Even with the same product, channel design and management could make that difference between success and failure, which we define as 'explosive channel value'. This course is designed to help understand the key elements of the marketing channels and appreciate the value of the question 'how do my customers want to buy?' Also, help future marketers (you) to apply the channel concepts into a real world. 

By taking this course, you will be provided with a foundation and framework in auditing/designing marketing distribution strategies. More specifically, you be equipped with tools to audit the current channel design and framework to create the explosive channel value, which involve both consumer-centric perspectives as well as firm-centric perspective. You will also be exposed to management issues in distribution channels.

The brands that a firm has invested in and developed over time are typically their most valuable assets. Product designs, manufacturing processes and other business processes may be easily copied, but a strong brand is something that cannot be easily reproduced. Many Asian companies are coming to terms with the importance of branding and are putting more resources into building a strong brand. This is evident from the number of branding awards (e.g., Singapore Promising Brand Award, Readers' Digest Most Trusted Brand Award etc.) being handed out in recent years. Companies are also paying top dollars for branding managers. This course aims to inform students about the current theories and findings on how firms manage brands.

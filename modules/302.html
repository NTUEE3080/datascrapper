This course is targeted at physics students in their fourth year. It aims at introducing how quantum mechanical behavior emerges in condensed matter systems at the nanometer scale, and how quantum mechanical laws govern their properties. The course will provide an overview of physical phenomena that are observed experimentally, introduce their underlying physical principles, and aims to build the analytical skills to describe these phenomena mathematically. This course thus will equip you with the relevant concepts of modern nanoscience and technology that will prepare you to follow or initiate research in field or to work in industry jobs related to applied nanoscience and technology.

This is a first course in quantum field theory (QFT) where we provide an exposition of basic concepts, mathematical techniques and a sketch of various applications in particle theory
and many-body problems in condensed matter physics . The foundational topics which will be introduced include path-integral formalism in quantum mechanics and OFT, canonical quantization , Green's functions and Feynman diagrams in perturbation theory. We will touch on the application of these concepts to aspects of quantum electrodynam ics as well as selected modern topics in condensed matter physics for which QFT is a useful framework, such as the fractional quantum hall effect, mean-field theory of superfluids , renormalization group and Landau-Ginzburg theory of critical phenomena.

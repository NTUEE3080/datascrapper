PART A
This module enables you to apply and integrate what you have learnt in the compulsory modules of the Minor or Second Major in Entrepreneurship Programme.  This is further augmented with a combination of practical and industry perspectives in business venture creation, implementations, and execution.  This course will provide you the platform and opportunity to be engaged with the corporate leaders, VCs, government leaders, and startup founders.  It will be a wholistic and practical approach to help you grow the startup from its infancy stage to a point that is ready for significant funding at every growth cycle of the startup phases.  You will learn, understand, acquire skillset, and knowledge to overcome growing pains of startup operating in different domains.  The other important objectives of this course are to cultivate the proactive mindset of the participants to tap into the ecosystems in Singapore, ASEAN, and other major global markets.  

You are encouraged during your early stage of the Entrepreneurship programmes to set up your own project startup team members with your course mates.  The startup project team should generate business ideas and / or explore various IPs from NTU to commercialise it further.  This will better prepare you to effectively participate in this module. 

PART B
You will source and seek out business ideas and can explore the NTU intellectual properties with market potential and translate it into potential commercial success.  If you decide to work on the NTU IP, you will be given the opportunity to work with the NTU professors and researchers who are the inventors of the IPs. You will form a team with your course mates to develop your business ventures with a business plan, develop a minimum viable product (if possible), and pitch this business idea to a group of investors.  Throughout the course, you will be able to have hands on and practical experience in founding and developing startups.

This course aims to provide you with the general knowledge and basic training of mathematics in biology. In this course, you will go back to the early days of biological research to recognize that some great discoveries in biology were possible only through application of mathematics. Additionally, you will study a few biological phenomena that most of you are familiar with, such as Mendelian genetics, population genetics, gene mapping, bacterial mutation, and enzyme catalysis. During the online course, you will learn how to 'translate' a biological problem into 'mathematical language' called an equation. Then you solve the equation by using mathematical tools and arrive at a 'solution' which is one of the equations of life. Finally, you will apply the equation to life situation to test whether the equation has been able to unravel the mystery that you were concerned with at the beginning.

This course aims to introduce basic concepts in immunology and engage students to work on open questions/ unresolved problems in immunology. You will learn fundamentals of the immune system including immune cells, their functions and distributions as well as molecular and cellular components of innate immunity and adaptive immunity. In order to properly understand immunological data, you will also learn how to analyze flow cytometry example data files using appropriate software. To further develop your critical thinking skills in the context of immunological research, you are expected to read and interpret original research publications and perform extensive literature search on selected topics in immunology. In addition to the 11 lectures of selected subjects, this course also requires you to present summary of assigned research topics and compose a short original research proposal per group. You will propose experimental strategies to solve the problems in the research proposal. In this way, you are encouraged to utilize the knowledge you have acquired throughout your studies, instead of just memorizing facts. This course should help you to understand immunological concepts and identify open questions, then develop some of the problem solving skills required for a career in research and other types of creative jobs.,

In this course, we will learn to use biophysical techniques to find out information about different types of proteins, in terms of concentration, secondary structure, oligomeric state, reconstitution systems using both detergent and lipid, purity, function and inhibition. 

The students will be provided with a set of initial problems to solve. To solve these problems, a hands-on approach will adopted that will make use of a range of different biophysical techniques. Each of these techniques will provide different types of information about the samples. An important aspect that will be emphasized is to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and to be able to design experiments knowing which techniques should be used first, and which last. 

Each daily session will consist of two parts (morning and afternoon). Each part will start will a 30 min briefing and will end up with a collation of results session and discussion. All days will have associated a pre-recorded video lecture for support, but a live 30 minute briefing will precede all sessions. 
In the first part we will look at ways to determine protein concentration using visible and UV light, and to measure the size of larger particles such as liposomes or detergent micelles using dynamic light scattering. 
The second part will look at how to obtain secondary structure information to assess proper folding, from infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism.  
The third part of the course will focus on size and oligomerization of molecules, and how this can be determined. To do this, we will use standard centrifugation techniques and also analytical ultracentrifugation (velocity and sedimentation).    
The fourth part will look at function, using kast kinetics (stopped flow), fluorescence and channel activity in model lipid bilayers. Inhibition by small molecules will be tested and dose response plots will be used to determine the affinity of the drugs.

This one-week course aims to introduce students to the taxonomic and molecular techniques utilized as a part of the toolkit of the modern botanist. This course includes lectures, a field trip and laboratory experiments, all of which will be held at the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG). Through the field trip, you will learn how a plant taxonomist uses morphological characters to classify species. For the laboratory aspect, you will learn how to perform DNA extraction and preparation of DNA libraries for high throughput sequencing. You will then assemble DNA markers to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree and, in combination with data on morphological traits, interpret your results and form conclusions regarding phylogenetic relationships between the species of interest.

The aim of this course is to understand pathologic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases at the molecular and cellular level. The hallmark of those aging-associated diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, is protein aggregation that occurs when protein homeostasis collapses. Cellular protein homeostasis is maintained by regulating protein synthesis, folding and degradation. Therefore, this course will address the whole life cycle of proteins and you will learn how failure of each step of the cycle is linked with neurodegenerative diseases. Various genes and pathways involved in aging are also an important topic of the course. This course will help you understand why debilitating neurodegenerative diseases are on the increase in our society and how to approach to cure them.

The main area of concentration is in the United States (US) Quality System Regulation (QSR), which has influenced much of how quality systems are managed today including the ISO13485. The course presents the US QSR in detail giving examples on how to apply each requirement. You will understand how to construct quality documentation for medical device manufacturing. The second part of this course teaches three essential sterilisation methods commonly used in the medical device industry. These are steam, ethylene oxide and radiation sterilisation, including the vital aspects of sterilisation validation mandated by regulatory and quality system requirements. You will be required to perform casework to test your ability to apply these concepts in real scenarios

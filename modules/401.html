Business is in the midst of a revolutionary transformation. Emerging technologies that combine AI, machine learning, cutting-edge visualization techniques, and social robots are fast revolutionizing the business workplace globally. Building a motived workforce is a critical responsibility of managers. To do so, managers must know why people behave in organizations the way they do. Research in cognitive sciences, artificial intelligence and neuroscience has generated significant insights that can enrich our knowledge of people. This course is designed to focus on processes and methods that can improve the attitudes and behaviors of organizational members.  You will learn to know more about yourself and others. You will also learn how to influence and predict your own behaviours as well as those of others. Within the context of a world of social media, AI, and machine learning, you will learn various organizational behaviour theories and concepts, and then apply them appropriately to real-life situations to make sense of human behaviours and human-robots interactions at work.  This course adopts a flipped classroom approach, which will give you ample opportunity to share your knowledge with others and also learn with them collaboratively.

Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

It also aims to enable students to critically assess the civic institutions that structure their local and global communities. To these ends, the course will examine the nature of ethics, its understanding across different cultures, and how it is manifested in concepts, social structures, and governance institutions. Topics to be explored include human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, inequality, and sexuality. The rights and duties of citizenship shall be a unifying theme. Students will think through assumptions they hold on all of these matters. They will be provided with the tools to understand various and even contradictory perspectives on these important issues.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

Computational thinking (CT) is the process of analysing a problem then designing and expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. It includes a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively implemented as programs running on computer. 

The aim of this course is hence to take students with no prior experience of thinking in a computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code the programs to solve some basic problems in your domain of studies. Student will also learn about basic program construct and simple data structures. In addition, the course will include topics to appreciate the internal operations of a processor.

This course will start with the core principles of Data Science, and will equip you with the basic tool and techniques of data handling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data-based inference, and data-focussed communication. The course will also introduce you to the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence - state space representation, uninformed search, and reinforcement learning. 
The course will motivate you to work closely with data and make data-driven decisions in your field of study. The course will also touch upon ethical issues in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and motivate you to explore the cutting-edge applications related to Big Data, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Python will be the language of choice to introduce hands-on computational techniques.

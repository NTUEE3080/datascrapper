This course aims to provide you with the general knowledge and basic training of mathematics in biology. In this course, you will go back to the early days of biological research to recognize that some great discoveries in biology were possible only through application of mathematics. Additionally, you will study a few biological phenomena that most of you are familiar with, such as Mendelian genetics, population genetics, gene mapping, bacterial mutation, and enzyme catalysis. During the online course, you will learn how to 'translate' a biological problem into 'mathematical language' called an equation. Then you solve the equation by using mathematical tools and arrive at a 'solution' which is one of the equations of life. Finally, you will apply the equation to life situation to test whether the equation has been able to unravel the mystery that you were concerned with at the beginning.

This course is designed to bring you from the basic fundamental concepts of genetics to current understanding of molecular genetics. In particular, this course will bring broader understanding of the genetic elements beyond the 'classical genetic dogmas', genetic concepts beyond the Mendelian laws and breadth of genetic information beyond single gene approaches. Moreover it will introduce modern genetic concepts and technologies including genome-based studies, large-scale genetics to understand human health and disease.

Singapore is currently an exciting place for Bioentrepreneurship and the bioindustry is an area where many activities are taking place and where opportunities abound. The huge capital and energy input into life sciences is a pillar for our country's economy and it is a strong indication of the tremendous opportunity that is present in this field. In this course, we will not only show you the structure of Bioentrepreneurship, but also impart the spirit and essence of it. Bioentrepreneurship and the launching of new ventures aims to create or build something new or different that has an impact on one's dream and also on peoples' lives and ultimately on the society. It will lead to new and improved products/services and create new jobs and added value for owners, investors and the society. Starting up a bioventure usually requires more money than you have in the bank, more energy than you thought you had and more skills &amp; know-how than you thought you needed.The knowledge you will gain will be of good value in your future professional life not only in start-up of business ventures but also in any position you will have in bioindustry.

This course is designed to tackle one of the most important issues in healthcare -  the discovery and development of safe and effective drugs against diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders and viral infections as well as for disease prevention and health improvement. It aims to equip you with the knowledge and skills that are in great need in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. This is an interdisciplinary course, combining chemistry with biology and pharmacology and dealing with both small-molecule drugs and biologics. It covers the basic concepts and principles of the three phases of drug action (pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics), the techniques and methods used in drug discovery and development (target identification and validation, lead discovery and optimization, preclinical and clinical trials), and specific topics on drugs acting on different classes of drug targets.

This course aims to introduce basic concepts in immunology and engage students to work on open questions/ unresolved problems in immunology. You will learn fundamentals of the immune system including immune cells, their functions and distributions as well as molecular and cellular components of innate immunity and adaptive immunity. In order to properly understand immunological data, you will also learn how to analyze flow cytometry example data files using appropriate software. To further develop your critical thinking skills in the context of immunological research, you are expected to read and interpret original research publications and perform extensive literature search on selected topics in immunology. Upon completing the course, you are required to submit an individual final report discussing current health issues and solutions. In this way, you are encouraged to utilize the knowledge you have acquired throughout your studies, instead of just memorizing facts. This course should help you to understand immunological concepts and identify open questions, then develop some of the problem solving skills required for a career in research and other types of creative jobs.

This one-week course aims to introduce students to the taxonomic and molecular techniques utilized as a part of the toolkit of the modern botanist. This course includes lectures, a field trip and laboratory experiments, all of which will be held at the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG). Through the field trip, you will learn how a plant taxonomist uses morphological characters to classify species. For the laboratory aspect, you will learn how to perform DNA extraction and preparation of DNA libraries for high throughput sequencing. You will then assemble DNA markers to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree and, in combination with data on morphological traits, interpret your results and form conclusions regarding phylogenetic relationships between the species of interest.

Power is the defining feature of international politics and security. As such, international relations scholars focus on great power-led regional institutions, such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), for their research, because those institutions possess 'power' in shaping international politics. However, there are so many other regional political/security institutions in the world, which begs an important question: what kind of power do regional security institutions that are not led by great powers have? This seminar aims to understand material and non-material power of non-great power-led regional institutions possess in shaping international and regional politics. To this end, the seminar offers you the in-depth knowledge of non-great power-led regional security institutions in the world, ranging from Asia to the Middle East to Latin America to South America. More specifically, the seminar explores their institutional history, objectives, and functions, exploring the applicability of the existing theoretical frameworks in the IR field. This seminar is geared toward those who are interested in secondary powers in international politics and security institutions.

A study of democracy cannot take place without analyzing political parties and elections. Political parties, in the West at least, have contributed enormously to the flourishing and stability of democracy. Parties link the state and society, take part in elections and contribute towards the structuring (and re-structuring) of political processes and institutions. Yet, the nature of political parties differ throughout time and space; similarly, the nature of elections differ throughout democracies - there is significant diversity in the way the electoral systems are structured, the legislations governing elections, the frequency of elections, the way campaigns are conducted, inter alia. As such, there is a need to understand the differing types of parties and elections, the impact that they have on society and political systems, who runs in elections, how voters make their choices, and the threats to our existing understandings of democracy and elections.
This module studies the development of political parties and electoral systems, emphasizing the analytical component (how and why) in addition to the standard descriptive approach (what).

Urbanization continues apace into the 21st Century worldwide, centering cities and metropolitan regions as critical units of politics and policy-making in issues including immigration, housing and climate c'hange. As large, dense and diverse human habitats, urban politics and policy-making are influenced by the dynamic triadic relationship among society, economy and land. In cities, land use allocation and production of space interact with the needs of diverse populations, capital and municipal institutions to generate contested spatial claims among multiple stakeholders. The size of its diversity and concentration of diversity also make cities places of subcultures, varied institutions and fragmented interests. As gateways for new ideas and adoption of new cultures, cities are also sites of dynamic social and spatial change that function as multi-scalar hubs of interconnections among the neighborhood, city, metropolitan and national levels.   

By 2030, Asia will emerge as the region with the most cities and with more big cities than anywhere else in the world, according to United Nations (2018). It should be expected that the 'local turn' in politics and policy-making experienced in American and European cities over the last two decades will continue, and Asian cities will follow suit, albeit differently due to their different political regimes. 

The course aims are twofold: 

Firstly, the course offers knowledge about the particularities of the urban environment for politics about space/place and policy-making, and an ongoing tension between people-based and place-based policies. This course draws upon multi-disciplinary knowledge in urban planning, sociology, geography, public policy and public administration to inform our understanding of urban politics and policy-making - essentially interdisciplinary areas of knowledge creation. 

Secondly, the course seeks to equip you with a set of skills to research and analyze questions related to policies that govern the functions, problems and life of a city. During the course, you should expect to engage in using comparative lens to examine problems common in the urban realm in cities outside Singapore, in order to inform creative policy recommendations that are applicable to the problems facing Singapore as a city-state

Qualitative research is an essential tool for deeper probing of diverse social phenomena and for designing effective public management strategies and policies. In the public administration and policy areas, narratives, case studies, observations, and more recently, focus groups have contributed insight and depth to our understanding of the structural, managerial, and environmental factors embedded in the public sector. Given this, you, as an independent researcher, need to understand the philosophy of qualitative, non-statistical social science research, focusing on how to design methods of qualitative research and how to conduct the analysis. The main objective of this course is not only to empower you to critically consume research through various forms of qualitative methods, but also to provide the fundamental skills for their own future rigorous research work (e.g., final year project). More specifically, while studying different qualitative inquiry approaches, you will be able to create a rationale for a qualitative inquiry that will be applicable to their research (or a hypothetical one) and to conduct qualitative research with data production (e.g., interviews, case studies, and observations). Lastly, you will be able to analyze and interpret their data using content or another discourse analytic technique. This course is organized along the following themes: (1) introduction of qualitative research, (2) research proposal outline, (3) developing and designing qualitative research, (4) observation studies, (5) interviews, (6) discourse and narrative research, (7) analysis of verbal data, (8) video data analysis, (9) case study, (10) content analysis, and (11) mixed methods.

You will learn various empirical methods for policy evaluation to measure the causal effects of policies. This include regression, matching based on observables, difference-in-difference, instrumental variable, regression discontinuity design. You will work with real world data and replicate policy evaluations using these methods using STATA (statistical software). Finally, you will also learn how to conduct spatial analysis, learning how to collect and extract data across space, and create maps.

This course will prepare you how to manage data, conduct statistical analysis, interpret results and present research findings in a rigorous manner. This course will also be useful for equipping you with relevant skillsets for their final year project.

This course will introduce you to the politics and policies of food in several countries, international organisations, and across time. Food is fundamentally essential to our physical existence, but it is also intensely cultural, with socially constructed behaviour and preferences that are change-resistant even in the presence of new knowledge, policies, and practices. How have different historical, social, economic, political, and institutional factors contributed to shaping national and international food policy outcomes? In this course, we begin with a heuristic analytical framework that enables you to study how interests, ideas, instruments, and institutions interact and affect the formation, development, and implementation of national and international food policy decisions. This course is organised around four themes: politics of food identity; globalisation or glocalisation; politics of food scandals; and international politics of food. By taking this course, you will learn how food is a powerful lens to understand contemporary politics and policies beyond consumption and nutrition.

'Power' is the most important, defining concept in international politics. Nevertheless, it has yet to be consensual definitions among scholars. This seminar aims to offer students the in-depth, comprehensive knowledge of the concept of 'power'. Through class discussions, students will learn the historiography of the concept, the debates over the concept in the International Relations field, the subfield of power (e.g. material and ideational power), and its operationalization and measurements. Applying these conceptual frameworks, you will analyze how the ongoing and past power transitions have shaped international politics. This course is more relevant for those who are interested in graduate studies in International Relations.

This course aims to develop your understanding of key concepts, frameworks and theories of public health and politics that are essential for analyzing the causes and consequences of disease outbreaks, the performance of governments worldwide in handling disease outbreaks or combating pandemics, and other key issues related to disease outbreaks (e.g. inequality, stigma, injustice). In addition, it aims to develop your reflective capacity and enable you to link theory to practice through examining case studies in different countries. This course is for students who want to develop and strengthen their knowledge and skills for analyzing public health and related issues. It is also for students who want to pursue careers in the public sector or in the field of healthcare.

Political theorists are increasingly turning to film as a repository of political insight that reflects fundamental facts about society and culture. This course will focus, however, less on the explicit political representations presented within specific films (for example, as in the narrative communication of already formed ideological visions of the world), in order to investigate the capacity of film to itself generate unique philosophical and political orientations via its singular form.   Through reading the contributions of contemporary theorists such as Alain Badiou, Jacques Ranciere, William Connolly, Davide Panagia, Joshua Foa Dienstag, Michael Shapiro, and others, we will investigate such diverse topics as film's relation to democratic thinking, the connection between cinematic and political representation, the political economy of film production, and film's embodiment of thinking the event. In addition, we will also examine a select group of particular film genres - specifically the Western, the horror, and the film noir - in order to understand what particular insights they communicate about contemporary political life.

This course simulates the work of the United Nations Security Council using a series of crisis simulations. Through the 'representation' of a country in simulations of the UN Security Council, you will develop skills in public speaking, research, and negotiation. In each simulation, you will research your country's position on a crisis facing the international community and then draft, debate, negotiate, and vote on resolutions to address those issues. Any student interested in pursuing a career in statecraft and diplomacy would benefit from this class.

Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

We begin with a brief, non-technical, conceptual introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications, suitable for students from any field. Then we focus on preparing you to participate in the global debates about the legal, policy and ethics issues that Al is already creating for humans. Among the questions considered: With AI tracking your every move on social media, what privacy protections do you have? Who is liable if an AI learns human biases and makes a racist hiring recommendation?  When our minds can be uploaded to computers, will they have legal rights? Is a self-driving car liable for killing a pedestrian? Should autonomous weapons be allowed to decide to kill a human? We compare possible answers in Singapore and American law and learn how informed citizens everywhere can shape AI's future.

From the invention of the ploughshare to the rise of the Internet, technological advancement makes an impact on economic organisation, social relations, and cultural life. In developing this central theme, this course begins with an understanding of the rise of science as a social institution and as a predominant form of rationality. In addition to understanding basic shifts in the experience of time and space brought about by scientific and technological advances, the course considers specific changes in the way that people live, learn, work and play. The human and social consequences  benefits and costs  of the impact of such advances are also examined.

This class aims to introduce students to the important concepts and tools of analysis concerning this universal social institution called the family.  We will also examine the role of new reproductive technologies in shaping the family - raising the specter of made-to-order babies for the very rich, while also opening up new possibilities for non-nuclear families (lesbian and gay parents, surrogate parents, etc.).  Finally, capitalism and the nation-state are forces shaping families and family life.  Sources will include historical materials, ethnographies, and mass media, both print and film.

This course provides a critical survey of key theories and issues in environmental sociology. Beginning with an overview of environmental problems in the contemporary world, we examine the social construction of nature and the development of environmentalism as a concept and a social movement. In particular, we analyze the challenges of sustainable development and the roles of the state, market, and civil society in responding to environmental issues. Specific issues such as climate change, food security, and renewable energy are studied from a sociological perspective. The course will also consider issues related to environmental inequality and environmental justice.

This blended learning course, based on the flipped classroom model, introduces higher-level verb tenses (simple future, conditional and pluperfect) along with a wider range of vocabulary and grammatical structures. All these, together with a wide variety of idiomatic expressions, provide the foundation for an intermediate level in the Spanish language. In this course, you will practice the four skills of the language in an integrated manner through an action-oriented approach with the aim to develop your pragmatic, linguistic and sociocultural competencies at the B1 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). You will further explore Hispanic cultures and societies through a wider range of personal and social situations and contexts. You will also be encouraged to become a more self-directed learner and to be creative and critical. After completing this course, you will be ready to sit for the external official examination DELE B1 (Diploma de Espa?ol como Lengua Extranjera).

The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard phrases such as `globalization,' `multinational corporation,' and `cross-border transactions,' 
and this course will discuss these ideas in some detail. Yet, despite the appeal of international business, many companies find that the process is not at all easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment.
This elective course aims to provide you with a clear basis of the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders. The course will address the various dimensions that shape the international business environment, as well as those factors that impact businesses themselves. You will be able to identify and understand issues that affect globalization and the international business environment. You should also be able to apply this understanding to design optimal responses to an international business environment created and impacted by these factors.
The course will develop your ability to analyse the countries you would like to do business in. It will help you to analyse and understand the macro and industry environment, develop an entry strategy, as well as an appropriate business model and business plan.
Students interested in the international business environment will find this course useful.

This course is designed to help students understand and implement techniques that underlie research on the management of human resources in organizations. Research plays an integral role in the management of people in today's organizations. Companies value talent with the skills to apply scientific research practices to help improve employee productivity and well-being. Similarly, many organizations also engage external consultants to help solve problems with their workforce via research. This course will equip students with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to function as both internal and external research consultants. The course begins with discussions of the principles of scientific research, and how they can be applied in a HR context. We then progress to cover the various aspects of designing, analyzing, interpreting, and reporting on appropriate research to investigate HR-related issues. Learning is cultivated through discourse and activities geared toward providing students with hands-on experience of the consulting and research processes.

Employment Law is critical to managing human capital. This course focuses on the employment law in Singapore as a foundation for an understanding of the employment relationship and its incidents. The course examines how the law determines the employment relationship from a contract for service (associated with independent contractors) as the cornerstone of the employment relationship. The rights and obligations of the parties are examined not only at the contractual level, but also from the wider perspective of the common law, statutory framework (where applicable) and other sources of law which impinge on the employment relationship. The course also examines how and when the employment relationship comes to an end - by proper termination, summary dismissal, frustration, threat of harm, etc and highlights claims for wrongful and unfair dismissal, and other remedies available to both the employer and the employee.

Besides a sound working grasp of the basic legal principles, the course is also intended to provide perspectives, theoretical and practical, from which to critically assess the possible solutions and the law's responses to vital problems commonly encountered both in Singapore and abroad. Selected topics are given a comparative international treatment.

This course aims to develop your Cultural Intelligence (CQ) - the ability to deal effectively with people from different cultural backgrounds (Ang &amp; Van Dyne, 2008)1. This course is designed for business undergraduates who are interested to learn how to deal with the challenges of working in culturally diverse environments (e.g., employees in MNCs, global projects, expatriation). For more than 20 years, research has shown that CQ is a differentiating attribute of global talents and leaders in the borderless world of the 21st century. General cognitive intelligence and emotional intelligence are no longer enough to lead successful global careers. The good news is that CQ is a skill that can be developed and learnt by almost anyone. In this course, we will focus on equipping you with a set of practical skills to manage intercultural relations at work and enhance your global talent profile as a result.

Leading and managing change is often cited as one of the top leadership priorities in organizations. Yet a significant number of organisations reported high failure rate in driving change initiatives. While employees are told that 'the only constant is change', they often do not get much positive experience when supporting organizational change efforts. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences. This is because change occurs at multiple levels, from individual's mindset change to group, and even organization. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation. Business leaders, together with their Human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations. The aim of this course is to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change.

The electronic communications environment and the internet challenges how businesses protect their informational assets. This course is designed to prepare the candidate to evaluate the strategies needed to face these challenges. This course also looks at the potential liability and the prevention of the misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis, interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with brands - embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works.

This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in Intellectual Property law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication - or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.

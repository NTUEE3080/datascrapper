Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

With digitalization now becoming the new normal in our daily life, this course seeks to equip students from different disciplines with problem-solving techniques with the aid of computers and to enable them to acquire some common but essential digital skills that are crucial in today's workforce. In this course, students will learn how to apply the concept of computational thinking and quantitative reasoning to solve problem and analyse data. They will also learn how to identify online threats and understand the principles of ethics and intellectual property rights in the digital world. They will also be exposed to current issues in the digital world, which they can better understand through the logics of computational thinking and quantitative reasoning, such as cybersecurity and the rise of fake news. In addition, students will also learn how to use some of the latest online tools for effective presentation, communication, and collaborative skills in teams while learning the course.

This course aims to equip students with the philosophical foundations necessary to understand theories of ethics and subsequently apply those theories to real-life scenarios and issues. It also aims to enable students to critically assess the civic institutions that structure their local and global communities. To these ends, the course will examine the nature of ethics, its understanding across different cultures, and how it is manifested in concepts, social structures, and governance institutions. Topics to be explored include human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, inequality, and sexuality. The rights and duties of citizenship shall be a unifying theme. Students will think through assumptions they hold on all of these matters. They will be provided with the tools to understand various and even contradictory perspectives on these important issues.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

The course aims to inspire a long-lasting mindset of awareness, critical thinking, curiosity, and collaboration across disciplines through the lens of current sustainability challenges. You will learn to analyze sustainability issues from different perspectives (social, economic, and environmental) and on different scales (individual, organizational, Singaporean, and global). You will then use these skills to discuss and propose solutions for sustainability challenges facing Singapore and the world.

Principals of Microeconomics has introduced basic concepts in market and discussed how  markets work in general. The aim of this course is to deepen the understanding of behaviors in the market by further examining the decision process of economic agents and the implied welfare consequences. 

In the first half of the course, we focus on how individuals make their decisions in the market by discussing two broad topics. The first is the analysis of price and income changes in the market. This discussion builds on what have already been covered in Principals of Microeconomics. The second topic is individual decision-making regarding time, risk, and uncertainty where we will also examine how the asset market works. 

In the second half of the course, we focus on analysing the welfare effects of outcomes in markets and society. To this end, students will learn different measures of welfare and criteria for efficiency, and how perfectly competitive markets help achieve socially optimal outcomes. Subsequently, we will discuss the problems related to making choices for society and how these may be reconciled.

This course serves as an introduction to various topics in discrete mathematics. Familiarity with formal analysis through simple problems in some basic discrete structures is a key objective rather than knowing these structures in depth. Specifically, the main aim is to learn topics from the following broad areas of discrete mathematics: number theory, logic, combinatorics, and graph theory.
This course aims to provide students with a solid mathematical foundation and is intended for first year computer science and computer engineering students.

Computational thinking (CT) is the process of analysing a problem then designing and expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. It includes a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively implemented as programs running on computer. 

The aim of this course is hence to take students with no prior experience of thinking in a computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code the programs to solve some basic problems in your domain of studies. Student will also learn about basic program construct and simple data structures. In addition, the course will include topics to appreciate the internal operations of a processor.

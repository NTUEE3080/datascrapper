It evaluates both sociological and psychological evidence and claims about the bilingual experience, and discusses the implications of these claims on the social perception of bilinguals in different societies. Despite the fact that more than half the world's population is bilingual, the general public still harbours many misconceptions about what it means to be a bilingual. This course examines some of the myths about bilingualism and explores the potential that bilingualism brings to individuals and society.

In this course, we will look at how language is used to construct taken-for-granted stories, metaphors and ideologies that perpetuate environmentally harmful modes of human existence. We'll take an eco-critical perspective and develop an analytical toolkit that we'll apply to various discourses, including those referred to as `environmentalist'. We will analyze a wide range of texts (pieces of journalistic, academic and policy writing, excerpts from textbooks, advertisements, mission statements and `about us' sections of various companies and corporations, examples of `green initiatives' and environmentalist campaigning, blogs, literary narratives and poetry), and unpack the main tropes, frames and strategies through which environmentally hazardous discourses become normalized. We will also look for the alternatives that promote ecological harmony. Our major topics include but are not limited to: development, growth, progress, climate change, animal rights, nature-as-resource, individualism, consumerism, culturally constructed images of the ideal body and food consumption. The course will provide a stimulating environment for you to enhance your critical thinking skills and acquire concepts that will serve you well in many prospective careers, especially in industries with environmental and sustainability concerns. And those are many.

Conversation analysis (CA) is a well-attested method within multiple humanistic and social science disciplines that uncovers the working of human communicative behaviours. CA is also used to comprehend the way we produce and understand naturally occurring talk in various social and institutional spheres. This course is an introduction to the methods of CA, a field of research which takes naturally occurring interaction as its object of study. You will receive hands-on training in transcription and systematic analysis of interactional data through this highly empirical and rigorous methodology.  With this training, you will become acquainted with how research is conducted in this field of study. Topics covered include turn-taking, adjacency pairs, opening and closing, agreement and disagreement, pre-sequences, preference organization, repair, story-telling, and the requesting, giving, and reception of information in conversation.

This course will start by introducing and discussing the notions of `discourse' and `discourse analysis', after which the long-standing debate on difference between speech and writing will be examined. Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use.

Through guided readings, lectures and hands-on tutorials, the student will develop an appreciation of key issues in the classification and description of the languages of the world. The main focus will be on the relationships between languages and the classification of languages into the larger language families, their geographical spread and historical background.

THIS COURSE INTRODUCES STUDENTS TO BOTH DEVELOPMENTAL AND ACQUIRED LANGUAGE DISORDERS. STUDENTS WILL EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORMAL AND ATYPICAL LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON UNDERSTANDING UNDERLYING COGNITIVE DEFICITS AND THE EFFECT OF COMMUNICATION DISORDER ON GENERAL DEVELOPMENT. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE COURSE, STUDENTS WILL STUDY ACQUIRED LANGUAGE DISORDER SUCH AS APHASIA, DEMENTIA AND OTHER SPEECH DISFLUENCIES DUE TO BRAIN INJURY. THERE WILL BE A SPECIAL FOCUS ON THE ASSESSMENT OF CLIENTS IN CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSIFIED POPULATION AS STUDENTS WILL EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF BILINGUALISM AND MULTILINGUALISM ON ASSESSMENT PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES FOR INTERVENTION.

This course introduces students to concepts and methodologies in study of language change. Traditionally the study of language change is divided between historical linguistics (sometimes called diachronic linguistics) and comparative linguistics. Both subfields study focus on different dimensions of language change. In the diachronic dimension we seek answers to how and why languages change over time. In the synchronic dimension we classify languages into families and study situations which lead to language change. The course will cover both descriptive and theoretical components. A fair amount of time will be spent on mastering the descriptive tools to enable students to independently analyze patterns of language change. At the same time, a number of theoretical issues related to grammaticalization and language evolution will be discussed to introduce students to current debates in the field.

The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with some of the ethnic, linguistic, geographic, and historical complexities of Europe from a somewhat oblique angle, through a course dealing with the languages of Europe in their structure and social dimensions, and providing ample exposure to the historical background as well as frequent hands-on experience with maps.

Anthropological linguistics is an interdisciplinary sub-field of linguistics and anthropology that examines the link between language and culture, and they ways they influence each other. It is concerned with the role of language and meaning in their social and cultural contexts, and how they contribute to creating and perpetuating social structures and cultural practices.

This interdisciplinary course provides you with a theoretical and practical training in researching language and culture from an anthropological point of view. Though selected readings, class discussions, and first-hand experience in doing anthropological/linguistic fieldwork, at the conclusion of this course you will appreciate how the study of communicative practices in their cultural settings can reveal profound insights into the diverse ways that humans perceive and interpret their worlds.

In this course, you will explore the psychological processes underpinning a variety of issues related to language activities. You will be introduced to language processing models and theories of how language is stored and learnt. Adopting a crosslinguistic approach, you will also learn to evaluate the relationship between language, thought and culture and focus on research pertaining to bi-/multilingual individuals.

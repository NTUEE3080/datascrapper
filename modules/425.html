This 13-week programme provides a complete and concise treatment of the key considerations in Good Manufacturing Practice for medical devices. The main area of concentration is in the United States (US) Quality System Regulation (QSR), which has influenced much of how quality systems are managed today including the ISO13485. The course presents the US QSR in detail giving examples on how to apply each requirement. You will understand how to construct quality documentation for medical device manufacturing. The second part of this course teaches three essential sterilisation methods commonly used in the medical device industry. These are steam, ethylene oxide and radiation sterilisation, including the vital aspects of sterilisation validation mandated by regulatory and quality system requirements. You will be required to perform casework to test your ability to apply these concepts in real scenarios

This course aims to provide students the fundamentals of microfluidic and Lab-On-Chip technology, including the basic fluid mechanics theory, microfabrication for microfluidics, microfluidic flow control and system development. Function of microfluidics components, such as valves, pumps and mixers will be explained in details. Applications of microfluidics and Lab-On-Chip will be highlighted by introducing the microfluidic components for life sciences, chemistry, point-of-care diagnostics, Organ-on-Chip and so on. Examples of emerging commercial microfluidic products (i.e. diagnostics cartridge, DNA amplification platforms) will be introduced during the course. Detailed case studies about microfluidic product development will be given on the development for disease diagnosis, prognosis, precision therapy, environment monitoring and so on. Through assignment, students will have the chance to research a particular type of microfluidic technology and its utility for specific applications

This course follows on from the module Fundamentals of IP to provide deeper knowledge and skills relating to some aspects of patent and registered design having substantial relevance in the engineering industry. 

The course provides you with the ability to identify aspects of patent and registered design law, understand how knowledge of patent and registered design law can drive an organization?s IP strategies, and assess potential courses of action concerning patentable inventions and design protection. Particular emphasis will be placed on the legal issues in relation to creation, protection, and exploitation of these intellectual assets. 

A note on the legal cases that are highlighted in the study units: these cases are for illustrative purposes in relation to the legal principles discussed; in general you are NOT expected to be able to recall them or use them in presenting arguments for assessment purposes.

This course provides you with a working understanding on engineering research and development and intellectual property (IP) in related context. It also trains you to apply and use IP knowledge to address real-life IP-related issues in the R&amp;D context. 

Key themes that will be covered are assessing IP issues related to R&amp;D, and the implementation and monitoring of suitable approaches to address these IP issues. Expanding on these, the course explores how an understanding of IP rights protection laws and their considerations can guide and support an organisation's R&amp;D activities and strategies. 

Particular emphasis will be placed on the practical and legal issues in relation to managing the R&amp;D value chain of creation/innovation, identification, ownership, protection, and commercial exploitation of intellectual assets. Case studies related to various branches of engineering including materials science engineering, will be presented and discussed.

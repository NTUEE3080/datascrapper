Working from observation
In this course you will consistently work from observation in order to hone your eye and become more sensitive to the dimensional world around you. You will learn to perceive proportion both intuitively and also through measuring. You will explore concepts of composition, line work, shape design, value structure, and colour, in order to translate your ideas and perceptions into a finished drawing or sequence.

Investigating and experimenting with materials
You will be continually compelled to challenge yourself with new techniques and materials. From pen and ink, to charcoal to watercolour, this course will serve as an introduction to many new materials and processes

Finding personal aesthetic
You will continually work toward developing your pictorial goals. You will be asked to first define your specific aesthetic goals including composition, line work, lighting effects etc., and then chart a course for improving towards those goals

Integrating sketching into a creative workflow
In this class you will be encouraged to make free standing drawings that function as independent art pieces, and also to utilise drawing as a primary step in ideation.  By utilising observational as well as reference drawing, you will develop a process by which to create well informed and well observed drawings.

The course is conducted in a studio/classroom or at a site-specific place corresponding to the assignment. The instructor and students observe the progress of everyone's work, and contribute critique as it is being made. Learning is a collective experience in the classroom, and you will problem-solve on the canvas, benefitting from a cross-pollination of ideas and input from your peers. It is therefore very important that you attend all classes. 

The semester begins with representational painting using slow-drying, indirect oil painting techniques learning basic paint mixing, colour observation and composition. Gradually you will become more independent with your work. The semester ends with experimentation of modernist direct application of wet-in-wet acrylic paint. 

The course also offers opportunities to collaborate with local museum exhibitions as well as international students, artists and communities.

Course content includes:
1.	Introduction to materials: 
             primers and painting surfaces;
             properties of oil paint;
                      properties of water based acrylic paint.
2.	Colour mixing and seeing colour:

This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in 20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy over a range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in design, interaction and animation.

In this course you will explore the development of contemporary art across Southeast Asia from the 1970s to the present, contextualised within the region's complex socio-political history. Covering Singapore and countries beyond, visual forms of all media, including installation, performance, and video are examined to understand how artists from economically and politically diverse regional societies have produced pieces revealing transregionally-connected expressive approaches specific to Southeast Asia. Through artwork analysis, in tandem with critical reading of assigned texts, you will develop visual literacy of regional contemporary art (particularly its themes and audience-engaging methods), and access to the art historical debates that distinguish Southeast Asian contemporary art in the global contemporary art arena.

This course is designed to situate art and artists in a number of diverse spiritual, geographical and historical contexts and in so doing allow you to explore art history through a variety of human beliefs. This will include, but is not limited to the rituals of worship, sacred spaces, divine objects, images of magic, illuminated manuscripts and so on. We will examine case studies that demonstrate how stained-glass windows tell us Biblical stories; ask what kind of secrets the faceless Venus of the Stone Age hides from us; suggest which tunes Islamic calligraphy `sings' to our eyes; analyze what Jocho's Amida Buddha has been telling us throughout the centuries, and much more. This course is open to all students from any academic background. Once completed you will have a deeper understanding of these concepts and they can provide the basis for further study in Art History and History.

Editing in Narrative Storytelling
Overview of the importance of editing in filmmaking, animation and the narrative storytelling world. Lessons aim to build a comprehensive understanding of the post-production process and how appropriate editing decisions helps establish a narrative alongside the development of a visual and editing style.
Post Production in Filmmaking
An investigation of how editing is integral in the creation of a film and the postproduction process plays in crafting of a story. Offline and online editing workflows are shared to the students to gain a deeper understanding of postproduction as a whole. 

Editing Beyond The Narrative
An analysis of strategies and styles in editing via different media. Creative exploration of rhythmic and metric montage in non-traditional cinema, music videos and found footage.

The Roles of Sound and Music in Editing
Through analysis of a variety of examples from films, students will learn about the role of sound in the development of the narrative edit. Basic concepts of sound design will be introduced in editing software and its role in offline editing.
Students will also learn to edit to rhythm and beat using Soviet Montage techniques.

Class assignments
Three creative projects, which explore editing for visual and audio-visual storytelling in diverse and complementary scopes of filmmaking ? linear sequential narrative with continuity editing, rhythmic and metric montage cutting to music and a short film narrative sequence. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

This studio course provides a practical study of the aesthetics, techniques and processes of audio post production for narrative film. In this course you learn how to edit and clean production dialogue, record sound effects (on location and in studio), use sound effects libraries, create natural sound effects (Foley) and create Automated Dialogue Recording (ADR). You will employ these techniques to create a layered sound mix that augments the emotional drive of a film, firstly as a pre-dub or temporary mix, and then as a final form of broadcast quality for professional delivery. You will also develop your ability to collaborate with members of a post-production team such as the director, editor, composer and music supervisor. This course provides fundamental sound editing skills that you can apply to any media project at any level.

The Basics of Photography:
An overview of camera operation: shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, ISO, exposure, exposure compensation, focal length and sensor sizes. Gaining an understanding of the exposure triangle and how technical choices affect the aesthetic of an image: depth of field, motion blur, grain, and lens distortion. 

The Digital Workflow:
Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. 
What Makes a Good Photograph?
An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. 

Developing a Photographic Series:
An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. 

The Role of the Photographer:
Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. 

Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: 
Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. 

Class Assignments:
- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. 

- To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.

- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

This course focuses on connecting the worlds of objects, experiences and meanings through a conceptual framework. It introduces the student to the importance of juxtaposing new and contradictory design situations with the task of understanding and resolving them. Subjects are examined through a conceptual lens: studying different aspects of semantics, imagery, perception, behaviour, beliefs, culture as structural frameworks in the development of ideas. Output includes, but is not limited to conceptual objects, user interactions, anthropomorphic interfaces, event/service situations, environmental installations, temporal experiments etc. Teaching in this studio course is by lecture, presentations, projects and assignments.

Conceptual Design Framework in the Creative Process:
The course begins with an introduction on the importance of placing ideas into a context that is driven not just by its form and function as the design genesis but instead through a tangent that looks at the design process conceptually prior to the practice of design ? a pre-theoretical approach to design by looking at why and how the creative process operates. Content here will critically examine of the design process itself, looking at the methodology designers take for granted in their creative and production activity.

Design as Discourse/ Critical Design:
You will be introduced to the practice of critical design and its variants - such as speculative design and discursive design, and how they serve as powerful tools for discourse about the design of the world. These `tools of design? are critiqued and explored through the use of language, imagery, fantasy, connotations, metaphors, semantics in the conception and development of students? projects.

Conceptual Design projects:
You will apply conceptual and critical design methods to realize design projects based on various themes.

Introduction to two and three-dimensional modeling principles and techniques.

Rendering:
Introduction to three-dimensional computer rendering techniques with camera, shader, and lighting effects using rendering engines.

Technical Documentation:
Introduction to technical documentation through the creation of two-dimensional drawings of three-dimensional computer models and output to print media.

Workflow:
Workflows for various modeling and visualization tasks will also be covered, such as working from sketches, orthographic views, development of primary curves and surfaces, and part detailing.

Class assignments:
You will produce a series of increasingly complex assignments and develop a foundation of computer-aided design principles and techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

In this course you will engage with two aspects of the human thinking process: 
1) the versatile investigation and problem-solving process known as design thinking where you will experience new ways of gaining insights when designing for a situation where the emphasis is on human considerations. By applying the design thinking process, you will respond with solutions that are appropriate to the intended audience. 

2) the holistic approach to investigation and analysis of systems thinking focusing on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and work over time and within the context of larger systems. You will be exposed to constraints and boundary conditions of systems, their interconnectivity and dynamics that define real-world challenges. You will use methods of systems thinking to break systems down into their separate elements and apply strategic processes to aid in the development of viable solutions.  

This course complements EE5082 Interdisciplinary Project Work providing the foundational basis based on which you can then apply to EE5082.

The role of Compositing:
Compositing is both the technical and artistic challenge of combining different image sources such as live-action footage, matte-paintings and rendered CG elements into one seamless new output. Digital Compositing plays a key role in visual effects, and it is essential to feature films, commercials, TV shows and animated films. Even non-effect films utilize compositing as the invisible art of image manipulation. The course will deliver a practice-based introduction to the basic techniques of compositing and its place within the production process.

Node-Based Compositing:
In contrast to the layer-based compositing, which centres on timing, a node-based workflow with an easy to read flow diagram of all processing operations, becomes essential when working on complex composites. This course will introduce both concepts but focuses on node-based workflows.

Compositing Techniques:
Through practice-based exercises and project assignments, you will learn basic and advanced compositing techniques such as layering and blend modes, colour correction, rotoscoping, tracking, warping, chroma keying and CGI compositing.

Artistic Considerations:
What makes a good composite? Through analysis of a variety of examples from film and animation, you will develop a sense of creative considerations and their role in creating a successful composite.

Class assignments:
Creative projects, which explore fundamental compositing techniques. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

Designing Pattern Collection:  
Part 1: The overview of essential methods of illustration for pattern motifs such as sketching, collecting of inspirational visual reference and translating gathered materials into mood-board. 
Part 2: Introduction to the essential tools used in working further from sketches for development of finished motifs, such as translating drawn elements into a single motif and into meta-motifs, digital tracing, layering, adding custom color palette and texture. 

Designing a Seamless Repeating Pattern:
An exploration of strategies to construct a variety of seamless repeat pattern variations and a simple and complex design composed of one or more motifs, multiplied and arranged in orderly sequence. Explained and practiced concepts and the construction principles of each pattern type, as well as the effects of the gradation, scale, texture and optical illusions. The overview of the pattern repeats systems such as block, drop, half-drop, brick, irregular, composite, sateen, etc., will be illustrated by examples from French Art Deco, Neolithic vase decoration, Celtic stone cross carving, North American Indian beadwork, medieval Italian silk, Persian manuscript illuminations, Chinese cloisonne, and many more.

Pattern Applications:  
You will identify the different requirements for conceiving specific use of the pattern and learn how to apply their patterns to mock-up. Following the overview of the range of pattern applications for all kind of designs, from textiles and fashion to graphic design, wall and floor coverings for architecture and interior design, you would develop a prototype for large-scale interior application.  

How to Design Pattern Collection Portfolio:
The topic will help you familiarize yourself with the terms and highlight important steps in crafting perfect professional engaging pattern collection portfolio.
  
Class assignments:
Four creative projects will explore surface design pattern: designing mood-board and pattern motifs, seamless pattern repeat designs, pattern design application and final pattern collection portfolio. Developed through lectures, tutorials, class exercises and peer/instructor feedback sessions.

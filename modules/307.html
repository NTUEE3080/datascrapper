Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

We begin with a brief, non-technical, conceptual introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications, suitable for students from any field. Then we focus on preparing you to participate in the global debates about the legal, policy and ethics issues that Al is already creating for humans. Among the questions considered: With AI tracking your every move on social media, what privacy protections do you have? Who is liable if an AI learns human biases and makes a racist hiring recommendation?  When our minds can be uploaded to computers, will they have legal rights? Is a self-driving car liable for killing a pedestrian? Should autonomous weapons be allowed to decide to kill a human? We compare possible answers in Singapore and American law and learn how informed citizens everywhere can shape AI's future.

This course will enable students to rectify a criticism which is often levelled against historians: that the field is becoming increasingly narrow, hyper-specialized, and does not prepare students to grapple with large-scale, long-term changes and processes, and to be able to formulate analogies with case studies from different parts of the world and periods of time. At the end of the course, students will be able to: 1) gain an understanding of the human and natural factors which led to the formation of large political, social, and cultural units in different areas in the world, 2) be able to differentiate superficial short-term processes of change from more profound but subtle evolutionary trajectories by isolating and comparing specific attributes found in case studies derived from different eras, 3) develop processes of reasoning which will enable them to distinguish between necessary and sufficient causal factors, and dependent versus independent  variables which fostered the growth of large-scale socio-cultural units with specific geographical correlates and boundaries or frontiers, and be able to explain why these variables differ when discussing the origins of political, technological, economic, or religious institutions and adaptations in various parts of the world, and 4) be able to identify and critique hypotheses and assumptions advanced by some basic works of scholarship dealing with topics on which the course focuses: for example,  what constitutes a common long-term evolutionary trend which can be compared  across different places and times, and what superficial differences mask or obscure common evolutionary processes between different societies or geographical regions?

What do we mean when we say that we are healthy? What role have doctors and medical researchers played within shifting social and political structures? How did modern medicine come to emerge and what impact did it make upon the changing cultural landscape of modern society?

In this course, you will examine and deconstruct the category 'Malay' as a lens into the broader processes of making and unmaking group identities in the maritime Southeast Asia region that historically used the Malay language as a trade lingua franca. You will conceptualize how Malay ethnic identity is an ongoing process and group boundaries develop with culturally specific markers along five major axes: economy, geography, political authority, religion and gender. As the course spans the pre-modern and modern periods, it will offer you an opportunity to compare and contrast how these processes change over time. Given the paucity of conventional documentary archives in accessing this history, you will develop new skills in interpreting alternative archives such as archaeological artifacts, the architecture of mosques and houses as well as literary manuscripts.

Advanced students will interrogate the interactions between science and race. The course is presented in three parts that will provide a theoretical and contextual foundation for the study of a topic that spans across diverse geographic locations, periods, and scientific and technological developments. The first four weeks are organized around the question of 'how do we know what we see or experience is what we encounter?' in the context of colonial events. The following five weeks examine issues of measurement, classification, and progress surrounding the construction of race in the 18th and 19th centuries. The final four weeks of this course examine more specific topics, such as gender, medical and technological interventions, and nationhood. At least one other history course highly recommended in preparation of this course.

Is Buddhism a philosophy? Is it a religion? Is it a set of rituals? This course will give you the tools to evaluate these and other questions you have about Buddhism. This course will cover Buddhist social and intellectual history, beginning with the emergence of the cult of the Buddha and the earliest monasteries in South Asia, then discuss medieval transitions in East and South East Asia, and end with a set of discussions on how to think about modern, post-modern and global Buddhisms. The course will engage the Buddhist experience from a wide range of thematic and cultural perspectives. Themes will include Buddhism and the family, the experience of meditation, death ritual, Buddhism and war, the body as an object of desire and repulsion, Buddhist medicine, and the structure of monastic life. Cultural contexts will include India, China, Japan, Cambodia, and Thailand, among others.

What do Olympic protests, Nazi fashion, Cultural Revolution operas, and The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye have in common? All are examples used in this upper-division World History course to probe the global intersections of popular culture and politics since the 19th century. By examining theatre, television, film, artworks, literature, broadcast media, sports, fashion, and other popular cultural expressions through the lens of critical theory, you will gain a better appreciation of how states, revolutionary movements, citizens, consumers, and emerging media have originated, shaped, and resolved contentious debates over popular culture. Topics include such issues as cultural appropriation, boycotts, propaganda and censorship. In the process, you will gain a deeper understanding of global social, cultural and political history and critical approaches to culture, while developing skill in the use of historical sources and in written and oral expression. This course will thus prove useful to anyone involved not only in public history but communication and the arts.

This seminar covers major traditions of thought regarding climate, climate change and its impact on society, drawing on history, science and anthropology. In this course, you will investigate how climactic factors conditioned the development of human societies and conversely, how human societies impacted the climate. You will analyze diverse theories and interpretations of climate-related societal change that span a global scale while being embedded in their own local political, economic and social contexts. This course will also equip you to conceptualize the basic precepts and terminology that define knowledge of the climate while inviting you to critique this notion through empirical historical evidence. You will also develop your skills in analyzing environmental public policy and distinguish between data-supported arguments and popular rhetoric.  

This course will be useful for you if you seek to understand how human societies, past and present, have tackled, interpreted and responded to climate conditions. If you major in history or environmental studies, you will find the class useful in facilitating informed readings about the present climate crisis and in helping you analyze more deeply how policy-making, politics and societal change can make a difference to it. This will be of value for students aiming for careers in the public service sector or in journalism.

Firstly, this course will allow you to develop in-depth knowledge and critical perspectives on the Cultural Revolution as history by familiarizing you with secondary sources and debates on the period. Secondly, using various types of primary sources, including novels, exhibitions, films, and debates in online spaces, it seeks to develop historiographical skills by encouraging you to compare various source materials and perspectives, including sources categorized as 'fiction.' Finally, it also seeks to contribute to skills in the realm of public history by looking into how the Cultural Revolution has been remembered in public media. 

This course would not only allow you to develop your skills as historians through the use of sources across disciplines and beyond 'non-fiction,' but it would also help you to develop 'historical empathy' by reading personal accounts from multiple perspectives as well as written in different time periods.  No prior knowledge of Chinese history is required.

This course is an introduction to contemporary political philosophy. States claim to have a monopoly on the justified use of coercive force. This is a stunning, and perhaps alarming, claim. It's all the more stunning once we recognize that this power is wielded, not merely over non- human animals or children, but over competent adults. Accordingly, the fundamental question of contemporary political philosophy is this: How is authority - i.e., the power to create moral obligations in others by means of commands -possible among free and equal moral persons? Anarchists think this question does not admit of a plausible answer. In this class, we'll see if they're right.

In this course, you will learn about various theories of the moral justification of state power.  You will critically evaluate arguments for and against these theories. Finally, you will be trained to write essays in which you argue for your own views about whether and how states can be morally justified in wielding coercive force.

This course offers an overview of central arguments and debates in early modern philosophy. We will examine different responses to what is arguably the central epistemological question of the period: is knowledge based on reason or on experience? By working through the answers to this question given by Descartes, Hume, Leibniz, and Kant, we will better understand key commitments of the Rationalist and Empiricist philosophical traditions, and get a sense of how Kant attempts to transform the terms of the debate. We will also have the opportunity to cultivate analytical and critical skills that will help us better understand the arguments of early-modern philosophers and their relevance today. The course will feature extensive textual and argument analysis.

This course provides an introductory treatment of biomedical ethics - one of the most practically relevant areas of applied ethics.  It is suitable for any interested undergraduate; it will not be assumed that students have previously taken a course in ethics or philosophy. The course will be of use to anyone considering a career as a medical clinician or researcher, and to anyone who wishes to learn about the role of ethics in biomedical practice.

Attention will be paid to a range of topics in biomedical ethics. Each of these topics highlights the morally relevant features of biomedical policy and practice. We will examine the moral rights of patients and other stakeholders vis a vis physicians and medical care institutions at large. We will also cover moral questions raised by genetic and reproductive control: for instance, the genetic screening of human embyros and surrogate pregnancies. Termination of life issues will also discussed - e.g., abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide - as will ethical dilemmas raised by the distribution of medical resources like organs and health care.

This course is an introduction to the philosophy of science, a major sub-field of philosophy. Philosophy of science is concerned with understanding the nature of science, and it intersects with other sub-fields of philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields. By taking this course, you will gain a nuanced understanding of how science produces knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically about the status and role of science in society.

This course offers an introduction to and overview of some of the most important philosophical currents of European philosophy in the 20th century. Its goal will be to help students understand the key claims, strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions of central areas of European thought, especially phenomenology, existentialism, critical theory, structuralism, continental feminism, psychoanalysis, hermeneutics, and deconstruction.

Through a combination of close reading and textual analysis, we will study how thinkers from different currents in European philosophy attempt to resolve the problems they think plague their predecessors, and how they propose to move beyond them.

Some topics and questions to be explored include the relation between perception, thought, and language; the philosophical importance of history; the limits of human reason and knowledge; what embodiment can tell us about experience; the role of ideology and power in the formation of human knowledge, etc.

Public policy is any institution, norm, or rule created by a government to guide people?s behavior. The study of public policy raises significant ethical questions. In particular: to what ends should citizens? behavior be guided, and by which means should a government guide such behavior? When might a public policy intervention by the government in the affairs of private individuals be unethical? Ethics and Public Policy will survey a number of areas in which public policy has been used to address social and political issues: crime, immigration, health, safety, inequality, religion, and the family. Students will question, debate, and reflect on the ethical principles which favor or disfavor the implementation of various public policies.

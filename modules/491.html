In this course you will engage with two aspects of the human thinking process: 
1) the versatile investigation and problem-solving process known as design thinking where you will experience new ways of gaining insights when designing for a situation where the emphasis is on human considerations. By applying the design thinking process, you will respond with solutions that are appropriate to the intended audience. 

2) the holistic approach to investigation and analysis of systems thinking focusing on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and work over time and within the context of larger systems. You will be exposed to constraints and boundary conditions of systems, their interconnectivity and dynamics that define real-world challenges. You will use methods of systems thinking to break systems down into their separate elements and apply strategic processes to aid in the development of viable solutions.  

This course complements EE5082 Interdisciplinary Project Work providing the foundational basis based on which you can then apply to EE5082.

This course aims to provide a firm understanding of marketing and is designed for students who have chosen to specialise in disciplines other than business. As you may already know, a working knowledge of marketing is beneficial wherever your career takes you. We will discuss basic principles of marketing. However, the focus is on its application and how this understanding could potentially enhance your future performance in your chosen field. A hands-on approach is expected and activities have been incorporated to encourage observation and enhance analytical ability. The course will require you to analyse businesses, evaluate alternatives, collaborate with team members, lead discussions, present your analysis and propose recommendations on selected organisations.

The course will begin by discussing sustainable marketing in the global context. We continue with marketing strategy and customer value. This requires an understanding of the business environment and buyer behaviour. We then focus on the 4 P?s, namely product, price, place and promotion.

Communication with the market is an important activity for many businesses and organizations. It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.

The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives.

The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities.

Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

Emerging trends in an increasingly interconnected world demand a new breed of the workforce - one that is not only well-trained in a single domain area but that also appreciates the complexity of real-world challenges. This course aims to allow students from different domain disciplines apply their domain knowledge as well as design and systems thinking principles to identify and solve open-ended real-life problems collaboratively.  You will be given opportunities to freely explore, take risks, pivot ideas, implement and/or prototype them, and learn from 'failures'.  The end-goal of this course will be a (possibly novel) prototype designed and created by your team to solve the problem you identified.  To improve your communication and leadership skills, you will also be required to present the development of your project to the class periodically.

As a sports coach helps an athlete develop and excel at a sport, a health coach helps a person or team to excel at living healthy life to the full, taking the best. This course will equip you with foundations of health coaching - skills useful for life wherever it takes you - whether you will be the next CEO, a full-time dad or mom, an entrepreneur or a cool government employee. It comprises a series of modules covering highly engaging topics on health coaching with a focus on sleep as a superpower. This is the first course in a stackable learning series that would equip you ultimately as a super health coach. The course consists of 13 three-hour sessions (two sessions of 3 hours per week) comprising of blended and highly interactive learning activities, conducted in the first six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22. The last session will be an assessment session held in the sixth week. In addition, this same course will also be run in the last six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22, and an assessment session to be held in the sixth week.
These sessions will cover the following seven themes:
1.	Being cool! Being super-woman and -man
(introduction to health coaching)
2.	Who cares about sleep? Superpower. (sleep)
3.	This is so tasty! (nutrition)
4.	Sweat the good stuff (exercise)
5.	Why? Why? It's driving me crazy! (mental wellbeing)
6.	Is it gonna harm me? (addictions)
7.	Relationships matter! (healthy relationships)
The modules cover the topic of sleep, but also important areas that affect sleep such as nutrition, exercise, mental wellbeing, addictions, and healthy relationships. These modules will be offered in a `flipped classroom model' where students self-study materials and subsequently have discussions and practical interactive sessions. The students will practice coaching skills which will be assessed in a role-based assessment with simulated roles.
The cutting-edge role of digital health supporting the coach and the person will be interwoven in every module.
Finally, we Singaporeans are one of the most sleep deprived people. Some might even be proud about regularly not sleeping enough. However, this comes at a high price for wellbeing and health. Utilizing the superpower of sleep has a wide range of proven health benefits including a lower chance of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, and not least making one feel better!
Recognizing that one can be cool whilst living healthy and shunning away from unhealthy lifestyle habits and applying early preventive measures to improve health is possible and is focus of this course. An important strategy to facilitate healthy lifestyle choices and promote health is through health coaching. Health coaching has been applied and shown to be effective in the prevention and management of chronic diseases and supporting lifestyle choices in healthy individuals. It is crucial to equip students with healthy lifestyle skills and knowledge and, specifically, on coaching techniques to create awareness about the importance of lifestyle choices. It will allow students to be equipped with essential skills to become health coaches and to take the role of health ambassadors later in their life. Moreover, health coaching can provide new career opportunities, with employment in healthcare expected to increase enormously in the coming years.
This course will be the first in a series of courses on health coaching, with the current course having a focus on sleep. Sleep is crucial for health and wellbeing, and it is known that many students do not get enough sleep However, sleep deprivation is linked to lower cognitive and academic performance, lower productivity, obesity, depression, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, and numerous other health risk factors. Exercise, nutrition, and mental wellbeing all have an important influence on a healthy sleep pattern.
A `stackable learning approach' is planned in which students will be able to `stack' certificates that will eventually lead to a professional diploma as health coach.

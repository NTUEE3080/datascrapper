                The Graphic Form course aims to develop your understanding of principles that underlie all good graphic
                design, whether print-based, web or digital. The goal of this course is to equip you with a set of
                practical and conceptual tools for both making and communicating in the field of graphic design. As you
                are gradually introduced to the basics of concepts such as research, typography, color, form,
                composition and layout, you will learn how to become visually aware and design literate. You will be
                introduced to invaluable practical skills and technologies of design production, both on screen and in
                print. Finally you will be placing and viewing these visual and technical skills and creating your own
                visual language.

                The class is organized along the following themes:

                1) Fundamentals of Image Making, Transformation and Meaning: exploring the key concepts of visual
                language of two-dimensional design in conjunction with image making and transformation (deconstruction,
                juxtaposition, signs and symbols, type and image)
                2) Fundamentals of Color and Meaning: introduction to color in cultural and historical context; symbolic
                use of color
                3) Integration of handmade and digital aesthetics: introduction to beginner's level knowledge of Adobe
                Creative Suite program (Illustrator and InDesign)
                4) Introduction to experimental book formats: introduction to basic principles of experimental layout
                and binding (Zine)

                Experimental interaction introduces students to the basic principles of interaction with media through
                collaboration, play and group-based projects. The overarching concept of interaction is investigated
                throughout the course in lectures, readings, and discussion of media art, which accompanies the hands-on
                projects. Students will be working with digital, networked, and social media, as well as found objects
                and other materials to explore viewer interaction and peer-to-peer forms of creative play. The course
                involves a study of DIY (Do it Yourself) and maker culture that better informs an understanding of
                interdisciplinary and open source thinking critical to the spirit of sharing and collaboration in the
                arts and design.

                Collaboration and Interaction
                Study interaction design practices in the creation of media projects through group collaboration.
                Engage in the creation of group projects that explore narrative as a process of collective narrative.

                Open Source / Open Culture
                A study of open source ideology and how this form of sharing and collective thinking emerges in the art
                and design arena.
                Study examples of DIY and maker culture that emphasize sharing and transparency in the creative process.

                Role of the Viewer
                Overview of viewer engagement through human interaction and social discourse.
                Understand the changing nature of the interactive design object or artwork in terms of how the viewer
                has impact and agency on the outcome of the experience.

                Social Media
                An exploration of social media platforms and how they are used creatively and critically.
                Reflect on how the individual in contemporary culture is impacted through the everyday, ubiquitous use
                of social media.

                Online Technique
                You will work with the Open Source Studio (OSS) Web platform to document their work and ideas, learning
                techniques of online writing and media documentation.
                You are taught to better understand how your work as artists and designers is enhanced through a better
                understanding of the online environment as virtual studio space.

                This module looks at the ways in which `madness' is presented and interpreted in selected literature and
                films from the late 19th century onwards. Through close reading of literary and visual narratives, you
                will consider how representations of dissidence, deviance and madness are employed to critique aspects
                of society and challenge the audience member or reader's habitual framework of understanding. The module
                core material will be considered within the contexts of existing constructs of reality, such as the
                representation of gender, societal expectations and sexual transgressions.

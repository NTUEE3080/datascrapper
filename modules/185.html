This course aims to introduce the structural, biophysical and chemical principles of key biological macromolecules found in living organisms. You will use your understanding of the underlying molecular bases and functions of the macromolecules involved in various biochemical reactions to solve problems related to nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and vitamins. You will also develop the ability to conduct biochemical experiments in the lab and design new molecules based on knowledge of the protein data bank.

Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

With digitalization now becoming the new normal in our daily life, this course seeks to equip students from different disciplines with problem-solving techniques with the aid of computers and to enable them to acquire some common but essential digital skills that are crucial in today's workforce. In this course, students will learn how to apply the concept of computational thinking and quantitative reasoning to solve problem and analyse data. They will also learn how to identify online threats and understand the principles of ethics and intellectual property rights in the digital world. They will also be exposed to current issues in the digital world, which they can better understand through the logics of computational thinking and quantitative reasoning, such as cybersecurity and the rise of fake news. In addition, students will also learn how to use some of the latest online tools for effective presentation, communication, and collaborative skills in teams while learning the course.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

The course covers fundamental concepts and organizing principles of physical chemistry that provide the basis for many aspects of chemistry and related fields, including analytical, inorganic, organic and bio-related chemistry. It will bring everyone to the same level of command of basic physical chemistry that is essential to progress to higher levels of core physical chemistry courses. Coupled with mathematical models, physical chemistry can provide quantitative results to compare with and understand experiments, and sometimes to stimulate new experiments. The concepts espoused in the course will be illustrated and connected with real world applications. Practical work is at the heart of chemistry. The laboratory component of the course therefore aims to expose you to chosen experiments which are meant to further consolidate the theoretical aspects learned during the course. The aim is to train you to apply the principles of thermodynamics, kinetics and spectroscopy presented in the lecture courses, in some illustrative experiments. This will help you gain familiarity with a variety of physico-chemical measurement techniques and instill in you the ability to work independently as well as part of a team.

Through problem solving, you would develop the physical intuition and analytical skills useful in these Physics topics.  You would also learn to apply these theoretical concepts in real world situations.

Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein &amp; Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.

While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts. It will help you to understand revision as integral to the process of composition, to convey your interpretations and ideas with confidence and clarity, and to consider audience and purpose when you communicate.

With digitalization now becoming the new normal in our daily life, this course seeks to equip students from different disciplines with problem-solving techniques with the aid of computers and to enable them to acquire some common but essential digital skills that are crucial in today's workforce. In this course, students will learn how to apply the concept of computational thinking and quantitative reasoning to solve problem and analyse data. They will also learn how to identify online threats and understand the principles of ethics and intellectual property rights in the digital world. They will also be exposed to current issues in the digital world, which they can better understand through the logics of computational thinking and quantitative reasoning, such as cybersecurity and the rise of fake news. In addition, students will also learn how to use some of the latest online tools for effective presentation, communication, and collaborative skills in teams while learning the course.

This course aims to equip students with the philosophical foundations necessary to understand theories of ethics and subsequently apply those theories to real-life scenarios and issues. It also aims to enable students to critically assess the civic institutions that structure their local and global communities. To these ends, the course will examine the nature of ethics, its understanding across different cultures, and how it is manifested in concepts, social structures, and governance institutions. Topics to be explored include human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, inequality, and sexuality. The rights and duties of citizenship shall be a unifying theme. Students will think through assumptions they hold on all of these matters. They will be provided with the tools to understand various and even contradictory perspectives on these important issues.

This course is part of the NTU 2025 Education - Common Foundational &amp; Interdisciplinary Collaborative Curriculum (ICC). It aims to provide multi-disciplinary competence in a cross-disciplinary, collaborative learning environment, with student interaction and collaboration across schools as a key learning foundation.  As the title connotes, the main objective of this undergraduate course is to examine what constitutes living a good, healthy and flourishing life.

According to research, individuals around the world pursue this 'flourishing life' in different ways, be it through improving one's physical fitness, seeking authentic relationships with others, or making a positive change in the environment.  Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. 

By the end of this course, you would have developed an awareness of what constitutes living a healthy and flourishing life, both of which indirectly contribute to a successful undergraduate education.

The course aims to inspire a long-lasting mindset of awareness, critical thinking, curiosity, and collaboration across disciplines through the lens of current sustainability challenges. You will learn to analyze sustainability issues from different perspectives (social, economic, and environmental) and on different scales (individual, organizational, Singaporean, and global). You will then use these skills to discuss and propose solutions for sustainability challenges facing Singapore and the world.

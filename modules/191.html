We begin with a brief, non-technical, conceptual introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications, suitable for students from any field. Then we focus on preparing you to participate in the global debates about the legal, policy and ethics issues that Al is already creating for humans. Among the questions considered: With AI tracking your every move on social media, what privacy protections do you have? Who is liable if an AI learns human biases and makes a racist hiring recommendation?  When our minds can be uploaded to computers, will they have legal rights? Is a self-driving car liable for killing a pedestrian? Should autonomous weapons be allowed to decide to kill a human? We compare possible answers in Singapore and American law and learn how informed citizens everywhere can shape AI's future.

The aim of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the theoretical foundations of microeconomics and macroeconomics at an intermediate level. The microeconomics component of the course is organized around (a) the theory of households making consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions, (b) the theory of firms making output-supply as well as input-demand decisions, and (c) the theory of public goods and externality. Based on the microeconomic foundation developed in the first part of the course, the macroeconomics component develops the relevant functions for the three major macroeconomic markets: goods, money, and labor markets. The functions include the consumption function, saving function, investment function, money-demand function, etc. Using these functions, macroeconomic models are formulated to study the effects of various shocks and policy actions on the macro economy. A consistent approach based on the rationality of economic agents is used throughout both the microeconomics and macroeconomics components of the course.

This course will enable students to rectify a criticism which is often levelled against historians: that the field is becoming increasingly narrow, hyper-specialized, and does not prepare students to grapple with large-scale, long-term changes and processes, and to be able to formulate analogies with case studies from different parts of the world and periods of time. At the end of the course, students will be able to: 1) gain an understanding of the human and natural factors which led to the formation of large political, social, and cultural units in different areas in the world, 2) be able to differentiate superficial short-term processes of change from more profound but subtle evolutionary trajectories by isolating and comparing specific attributes found in case studies derived from different eras, 3) develop processes of reasoning which will enable them to distinguish between necessary and sufficient causal factors, and dependent versus independent  variables which fostered the growth of large-scale socio-cultural units with specific geographical correlates and boundaries or frontiers, and be able to explain why these variables differ when discussing the origins of political, technological, economic, or religious institutions and adaptations in various parts of the world, and 4) be able to identify and critique hypotheses and assumptions advanced by some basic works of scholarship dealing with topics on which the course focuses: for example,  what constitutes a common long-term evolutionary trend which can be compared  across different places and times, and what superficial differences mask or obscure common evolutionary processes between different societies or geographical regions?

While health and illness are key issues across the boundaries of nations and times, they have been highly contested subjects in terms of definition, meaning, and implication. What do we mean when we say that we are healthy? What role have doctors and medical researchers played within shifting social and political structures? How did modern medicine come to emerge and what impact did it make upon the changing cultural landscape of modern society? The course will give you an opportunity to think about the shifting practices and ideas of health and illness, along with the role of the professionals who stays at the center of health-related activities.

In this course, you will examine and deconstruct the category 'Malay' as a lens into the broader processes of making and unmaking group identities in the maritime Southeast Asia region that historically used the Malay language as a trade lingua franca. You will conceptualize how Malay ethnic identity is an ongoing process and group boundaries develop with culturally specific markers along five major axes: economy, geography, political authority, religion and gender. As the course spans the pre-modern and modern periods, it will offer you an opportunity to compare and contrast how these processes change over time. Given the paucity of conventional documentary archives in accessing this history, you will develop new skills in interpreting alternative archives such as archaeological artifacts, the architecture of mosques and houses as well as literary manuscripts.

Advanced students will interrogate the interactions between science and race. The course is presented in three parts that will provide a theoretical and contextual foundation for the study of a topic that spans across diverse geographic locations, periods, and scientific and technological developments. The first four weeks are organized around the question of 'how do we know what we see or experience is what we encounter?' in the context of colonial events. The following five weeks examine issues of measurement, classification, and progress surrounding the construction of race in the 18th and 19th centuries. The final four weeks of this course examine more specific topics, such as gender, medical and technological interventions, and nationhood. At least one other history course highly recommended in preparation of this course.

Is Buddhism a philosophy? Is it a religion? Is it a set of rituals? This course will give you the tools to evaluate these and other questions you have about Buddhism. This course will cover Buddhist social and intellectual history, beginning with the emergence of the cult of the Buddha and the earliest monasteries in South Asia, then discuss medieval transitions in East and South East Asia, and end with a set of discussions on how to think about modern, post-modern and global Buddhisms. The course will engage the Buddhist experience from a wide range of thematic and cultural perspectives. Themes will include Buddhism and the family, the experience of meditation, death ritual, Buddhism and war, the body as an object of desire and repulsion, Buddhist medicine, and the structure of monastic life. Cultural contexts will include India, China, Japan, Cambodia, and Thailand, among others.

What do Olympic protests, Nazi fashion, Cultural Revolution operas, and The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye have in common? All are examples used in this upper-division World History course to probe the global intersections of popular culture and politics since the 19th century. By examining theatre, television, film, artworks, literature, broadcast media, sports, fashion, and other popular cultural expressions through the lens of critical theory, you will gain a better appreciation of how states, revolutionary movements, citizens, consumers, and emerging media have originated, shaped, and resolved contentious debates over popular culture. Topics include such issues as cultural appropriation, boycotts, propaganda and censorship. In the process, you will gain a deeper understanding of global social, cultural and political history and critical approaches to culture, while developing skill in the use of historical sources and in written and oral expression. This course will thus prove useful to anyone involved not only in public history but communication and the arts.

This seminar covers major traditions of thought regarding climate, climate change and its impact on society, drawing on history, science and anthropology. In this course, you will investigate how climactic factors conditioned the development of human societies and conversely, how human societies impacted the climate. You will analyze diverse theories and interpretations of climate-related societal change that span a global scale while being embedded in their own local political, economic and social contexts. This course will also equip you to conceptualize the basic precepts and terminology that define knowledge of the climate while inviting you to critique this notion through empirical historical evidence. You will also develop your skills in analyzing environmental public policy and distinguish between data-supported arguments and popular rhetoric.  

This course will be useful for you if you seek to understand how human societies, past and present, have tackled, interpreted and responded to climate conditions. If you major in history or environmental studies, you will find the class useful in facilitating informed readings about the present climate crisis and in helping you analyze more deeply how policy-making, politics and societal change can make a difference to it. This will be of value for students aiming for careers in the public service sector or in journalism.

Firstly, this course will allow you to develop in-depth knowledge and critical perspectives on the Cultural Revolution as history by familiarizing you with secondary sources and debates on the period. Secondly, using various types of primary sources, including novels, exhibitions, films, and debates in online spaces, it seeks to develop historiographical skills by encouraging you to compare various source materials and perspectives, including sources categorized as 'fiction.' Finally, it also seeks to contribute to skills in the realm of public history by looking into how the Cultural Revolution has been remembered in public media. 

This course would not only allow you to develop your skills as historians through the use of sources across disciplines and beyond 'non-fiction,' but it would also help you to develop 'historical empathy' by reading personal accounts from multiple perspectives as well as written in different time periods.  No prior knowledge of Chinese history is required.

The Green Earth covers some of the most important themes in environmental history
which have informed academic scholarship during the last 20 to 30 years. The course
begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and
development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation
of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of
warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had
brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course
focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions
of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to
elements, starting with agriculture (-land-) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject
of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous
desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and
pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals,
particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction
of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several
millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have
lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at
the end of the course.

This course explores how disease has shaped the way humans have evolved, and also how diseases have evolved to exploit humans. After considering the different techniques available to investigate health in past populations, we discuss the biological and genetic impact of disease upon natural selection. The cultural consequences of ill health will also be explored, including the social and religious interpretation of why people became ill, coping strategies by past civilizations to live with diseases significant in their societies, and attempts to heal the sick.

List of key topics taught is as follows: 
1. Reasons to study health in the past and how to study health in the past
2. Disease, warfare and migration
3. Early attempts to treat disease
4. Common diseases among early and modern Austronesians in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania
5. The origins of human infectious disease
6. Human parasites, allergies and evolution
7. Health in human ancestors
8. Disease in early civilizations
9. Social consequences of disease
10. The future evolution of disease

After the end of the Second World War, the British Empire shifted its imperialist policy due to increased economic costs to sustain its colonies and the loss of strategically important spots, such as India and Suez. The rise of the United States and the Soviet Union also led to changing balance of power. With the rise of nationalist sentiments in Asia and Africa, it became increasingly uneconomical and difficult for Britain to hold on to colonies, leading to decolonisations in the 1950s and 1960s. This module explores the political, economic, social and diplomatic factors behind the decline of the British Empire and whether the Empire was strong or weak post-1945. It also examines how patterns of decolonisation varied in British colonies in Asia and Africa. Decolonisation was executed through diverging means in different pace. For example, democratisations and decentralisations took place in Malaya and Kenya soon after the Second World War while democratic reforms were absent in Hong Kong. While British administration ceased in Singapore in 1963, Hong Kong remained a British colony until 1997. Lastly, the module investigates various means employed by the colonial governments to suppress dissidents and capture the `hearts and minds' of the locals during the transitional period, ranging from psychological tests conducted in the Malaya Emergency and secret opinion polling systems in Hong Kong, to `sanitary surveillance' in Singapore and repressive interrogation camps in Mau Mau Uprisings. In doing so, students will critically examine the relationships between the British Empire and its colonies, the Cold War and decolonisations, and culture and colonial statecrafts in Africa and Asia from 1945 to 1997.

This module explores the diplomatic, political, social and economic history of British Hong Kong during the period from 1945 to 1997. It examines how development in China and decolonization of the British Empire influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony.

Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between colonial Hong Kong, Britain and China via six inter-locking themes: imperial diplomacy, diplomatic end game, social order and colonial state-building, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of Hong Kong during the colonial era, useful insights in China's development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired.

Colonial Archaeology of Southeast Asia provides a focused and close examination of the key questions and issues relating to the colonial period, which corresponds to the time frame between 1500 and 1900. In terms of periodization, the period spans the time from the early modern through the modern historical periods of Southeast Asian history. In the course, students gain an understanding of the objectives, tools and sources of archaeology and history. The course also ensures that students continue to be informed by the goals of archaeology defined by its focus on material culture and close link to history, especially in the study of past cultures, societies and technologies of periods when historical documentation was also available. By examining case studies, images, and readings, the course allows the students to build on what they have learned from the other archaeology and historical archaeology courses such as HH1125, HH2025 and HH2125 to interpret and critically evaluate the information presented in this course. Students will learn to identify and discuss key questions, approaches, methods, and sources related to colonial archaeology at the end of the course. In particular, students will acquire the ability to utilize historical archaeology methodology to analyze the sources of colonial and modern Southeast Asia.

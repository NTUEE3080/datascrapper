The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard phrases such as `globalization,' `multinational corporation,' and `cross-border transactions,' 
and this course will discuss these ideas in some detail. Yet, despite the appeal of international business, many companies find that the process is not at all easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment.
This elective course aims to provide you with a clear basis of the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders. The course will address the various dimensions that shape the international business environment, as well as those factors that impact businesses themselves. You will be able to identify and understand issues that affect globalization and the international business environment. You should also be able to apply this understanding to design optimal responses to an international business environment created and impacted by these factors.
The course will develop your ability to analyse the countries you would like to do business in. It will help you to analyse and understand the macro and industry environment, develop an entry strategy, as well as an appropriate business model and business plan.
Students interested in the international business environment will find this course useful.

Leading and managing change is often cited as one of the top leadership priorities in organizations. Yet a significant number of organisations reported high failure rate in driving change initiatives. While employees are told that 'the only constant is change', they often do not get much positive experience when supporting organizational change efforts. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences. This is because change occurs at multiple levels, from individual's mindset change to group, and even organization. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation. Business leaders, together with their Human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations. The aim of this course is to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change.

The electronic communications environment and the internet challenges how businesses protect their informational assets. This course is designed to prepare the candidate to evaluate the strategies needed to face these challenges. This course also looks at the potential liability and the prevention of the misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis, interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with brands - embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works.

This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in Intellectual Property law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication - or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.

This course will introduce you to key consumer behavior concepts, thus equipping you - as current or future managers - with the knowledge to evaluate and design effective marketing
decisions. After the completion of this course, you should be able to understand the psychology of how consumers think, feel, reason, and choose between different alternatives (e.g., brands, products), how social and cultural environments (e.g., friends, family, and culture) influence
consumer behaviour, and how marketers can adapt and improve marketing campaigns/strategies to more effectively reach and influence the consumers. You will also learn to appreciate the relevance of consumer behaviour for marketers and policymakers.

As a result of the interconnected nature of the global economy we need to acknowledge the role that Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer and Consumer-to-Consumer relationships plays in marketing. The impact and prevalence of these relationships mean that they should be at the heart of firms' decision making. This course helps students understand the reality of the business markets and the tasks of managing the complex, multiple and overlapping relationships in which firms are enmeshed and on which they can rely for competitive success. It moves away from the traditional 4Ps (product, pricing, promotion and place) paradigm and take a more holistic and integrated approach in understanding marketing. In addition, a strong relational approach is used in opposite to a transactional view of marketing. Marketing is viewed in this course as the process of managing and optimizing relationships, networks and interactions.

Consumers today are bombarded with thousands of messages on a daily basis. Consumers are also more skeptical, more fragmented and more difficult to reach than before. To meet these challenges, it is increasingly important for companies to develop a coherent marketing communication strategy. Marketers also need to keep searching for new ways to communicate with the consumers and make sure that the messages about their brands are perceived by the target consumers as they originally intend. As you will learn in this course, integrated marketing communications (IMC) is one of the fundamental building block for a company's strategy and success.

Marketing Channel is one of the most important assets in the organization's overall marketing strategy in this era where there exists much congestion in the market for similar products. Organizations must reach their consumers effectively but then how should we approach them? Innovation can come from 'place' by focusing on 'How do my customers want to buy?'  

Even with the same product, channel design and management could make that difference between success and failure, which we define as 'explosive channel value'. This course is designed to help understand the key elements of the marketing channels and appreciate the value of the question 'how do my customers want to buy?' Also, help future marketers (you) to apply the channel concepts into a real world. 

By taking this course, you will be provided with a foundation and framework in auditing/designing marketing distribution strategies. More specifically, you be equipped with tools to audit the current channel design and framework to create the explosive channel value, which involve both consumer-centric perspectives as well as firm-centric perspective. You will also be exposed to management issues in distribution channels.

The brands that a firm has invested in and developed over time are typically their most valuable assets. Product designs, manufacturing processes and other business processes may be easily copied, but a strong brand is something that cannot be easily reproduced. Many Asian companies are coming to terms with the importance of branding and are putting more resources into building a strong brand. This is evident from the number of branding awards (e.g., Singapore Promising Brand Award, Readers' Digest Most Trusted Brand Award etc.) being handed out in recent years. Companies are also paying top dollars for branding managers. This course aims to inform students about the current theories and findings on how firms manage brands.

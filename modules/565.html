This course covers over one thousand years of English writing, from Anglo-Saxon to Neoclassical literature. We will focus primarily on the relationship between 'form' and 'history' in seeking to understand this literature, where 'form' refers to a given text's genre or mode (e.g., 'revenge tragedy'), its linguistic and narrative characteristics, and so on, while 'history' means both material and cultural formations as these change through time. While we will engage closely with questions of traditional literary history, we will also consider how more recent ways of reading and thinking about literature'from deconstruction to queer theory' might enrich our understanding of these mostly canonical works. The course will touch upon a number of 'big' themes in English literature, with particular emphasis on the rise of individualism and the impact of the Reformation on early-modern culture and thought.

This survey aims to provide a stimulating introductory overview of influential literary works from the Romantics to contemporary writing. While the majority of texts will be drawn from the "classic," or canonical, works of English Literature, we shall also critically question the rationale of a canon-formation that focuses specifically on British writers. We shall trace European influences and debate the impact of popular culture on literary developments. In thus offering the study of a number of canonical and non-canonical texts, we will stress specifically the revolution in poetry achieved by the Romantics, the rise of the novel as a new genre, the experimental nature of nineteenth and twentieth-century literature, the impact of modernism and postmodernism, and the ways these developments have defined our understanding of literature and culture.

This is a comprehensive introduction to medieval English literature, with a focus on the Middle English period. Middle English literature embraces an astonishing variety of genres and subjects, from the aggressive debate of 'The Owl and the Nightingale' to the painful tragedy (and some comedy) of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In exploring this diversity, we will question the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic "Age of Faith" that can be neatly opposed to our own modernity. The course thus aims to consider early English literature in light of important historical and cultural changes during the Middle Ages.

Selected texts will be read in Middle English with the help of a glossary; no experience reading Old or Middle English is required.

Victorian Literature introduces a selection of literary works from the nineteenth century, while drawing attention to neglected aspects of this extremely versatile, fast changing, and intriguingly self-conscious age. The course aims to foster excitement about the indeterminacies, doubts, and fissures that shaped the Victorian period's greatest cultural achievements. At the same time, we shall critically reconsider the many legacies of the shifts it saw in epistemological, cultural, and specifically literary conceptualisations.

This module provides an overview of the most important works, themes, and concerns of the Victorian age, one of the most prolific periods of English literature. You will learn how to analyze, discuss, and write criticism about canonical texts and the popular culture of the time. You will also be encouraged to evaluate critically your attitudes and responses to "the Victorians".

This course surveys Modernist Literature in English, spanning from the turn of the century to the 1930s. This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer.

This course considers the manner in which art responds to war, and the ways in which war and violence are appropriated in both aesthetic and critical discourse. We will examine the centrality of war to human and civilisational experience, and also consider the conditions of inevitability that bind human experience to a deep-seated violent impulse. Issues raised by this course include, but are not confined to:

	the structural constitution of war
	the differences and similarities between war and violence
	the inherent ambivalence of war
	semantics, rhetorics and discourse of war
	artistic expression of war experience as ambiguating gesture
	Just War or just war?
	visual vs textual representations

In this module we will be focusing on literature produced in response to the historical experience of Empire. We will look at the way in which literary narratives have been used to legitimize the imperial project - justifying its `civilizing mission', reinforcing certain racial stereotypes and hierarchies, and contributing to an archive of knowledge on colonial subjects and territories. However this complicity between literature and Empire is only part of the story. We will also be exploring the ambivalence that so often haunts the peripheries of imperial narratives, and examining the way in which literature has served to critique colonial ideologies and practices. Our discussion will be wide-ranging, both historically and geographically. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will also include analyses of Herge's

As we read we will consider the formulization of an "American" "Early" "Literature". Whatconstitutes "America" before 1789? Are these texts "literary"? Does our study of these texts require a teleological perspective? What factors determined the canonization of only English language texts from a multi-lingual, multi-colonial, and native population? How has pre-revolutionary America been represented in the past and in our own time? How do these 'secondary' histories determine what of the past gets preserved, celebrated, and canonized? What aspects of early America are forgotten in this process? What can we learn about contemporary American culture from these imaginative representations?

This course surveys the development of a distinctly American literary culture and history in the nineteenth century. In exploring this expanding terrain, we will encounter new genres and media, consider the impact of race and gender on ideas of freedom and democracy, and assess the formation of an American canon. Our goal is a critical familiarity with texts that have claimed a place in American literary history and the social movements that produced them.

This course analyzes and interprets American culture mostly from the first half of the twentieth century, including fiction, poetry, and film, looking at the way that the conditions of modernity engendered new forms that go beyond the earlier novel/romance dichotomy. We'll study realism (Cather); naturalism in its classic, modernist, and Depression-era forms (London, Stein, Steinbeck, respectively); as well as classic modernists Eliot, Hemingway, and West, examining their experiments involving perspective, language, history, memory, and the surreal. We'll study the dark filmic vision of film noir, focusing on patterns of corrupt morality, cold passion, and dehumanizing modernity. The short fiction of the Southern Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor will be discussed in terms of the grotesque and the cultural division of country and city. We'll read Naked Lunch, Burroughs' shockingly experimental work examining power and addiction. We'll conclude with a novel by Robinson that evokes a hybrid world of nature and domesticity through non-hierarchical, non-individualized discourse.

Through the interpretation and study of selected works of American literature and culture from 1945 to the present, we will consider the ways that writers respond to changes in the economic, political, and social conditions of the United States during the postmodern era. While some writers reassert long-standing themes such as the individual's quest for freedom defined against the constrictions of status-quo, domestic life (Kerouac, Ginsberg, Morrison, the Confessional Poets), others pose intellectual questions about language and meaning through metafictional innovation (Nabokov, Vonnegut, Barth) or confront national myths such as the American Dream (Dylan, Mamet) and the romance of the Western frontier (McCarthy). In an age where mass culture has replaced intellectual literacy, contemporary American authors ponder the place of the novelist in the world (DeLillo), reflect on the meaning of ethnic identity (Walker), and seek out a critical perspective from which to view the present

This module explores a diverse range of African literatures -  including works from Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa. It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies.

Introduction to Publishing is taught by guest instructors from the field of publishing.  It will introduce you to the economic, legal, and social factors that influence which texts are published and how those texts circulate.  You will consider publishing from a range of perspectives, including authors, editors, and the publishers themselves, and think about the role of publishing in disseminating culture and information.

This course combines theoretical and practical approaches.  You will learn how literary productions are shaped by figures and forces beyond the author.  You will also consider how the skills you learn as English students relate to various roles in the field of publishing, whether as an author, an editor, a publicist, or a marketing professional.

Although this course will consider a range of different types of publishing, it will pay specific attention to contemporary Singapore.

If turning a book into a film is perhaps the most obvious form of what we understand under adaptation and what we conceive of as the most often expected link between literature and film, how do films impact on how we read? In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature.
This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature.

Martin Esslin coined Theatre of the Absurd to group together a substantial number of post-World
War II dramatic works that questioned realism and challenged the conventional dramatic form.'
There was no Absurdist movement, and most playwrights whom we consider Absurdists did not
identify themselves as such. Nevertheless, the designation is useful to begin thinking about their	shared concern for what it means to be human in a time of social and political upheaval. You will be provoked to consider this central question as you learn more about the playwrights' dramatizations of habit, time, humour and suffering. The course will train you to close read Absurdist plays, and develop an appreciation for theirI destabilising effects on actors and the audience member. By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to differentiate between the social, historical,philosophical factors that affect the writing and production of absurdist drama. The seminar format will facilitate discussions as	 you share your reading, viewing, and performance/staging experiences with the class.

Course Content
The discomfort and frustration evoked by the Theatre of the Absurd force character(s) and the
audience to confront the question, "What does it mean to be human?" Each week, we will look	closely at one play, and if a recording of a production is available, we will view snippets in class to give you an idea of how each play could be staged. You will also perform scenes from the play in	1, class. The course will provoke you to consider what it means to be human as we look closely at absurdist portrayals of habit, time, humour and suffering.

Who was King Arthur, and how did he evolve into the household name that he is today? Where did the legends of his knights originate, and how did they develop over time? How widespread were the Arthurian legends across medieval Europe, and what made them so appealing to authors of English literature in more recent centuries? These are some of the questions to be explored on this module, which surveys the long development of several of the major narratives involving King Arthur and his knights, stretching from their medieval origins to modern literary adaptations. The first half of the module focusses on medieval texts, all of which will be studied in translation. You will gain an understanding of the generic, stylistic and thematic individuality of these medieval texts, as well as an awareness of the ways in which each text reflects the composer's explorations of the fundamental moral questions underpinning themes such as chivalric heroism and romantic love. The second half of the module turns towards modern reception, and here you will explore the changing significance and reimaginations of the Arthurian tradition in the nearer past. As Arthurian adaptations and reinventions continue to be produced and to occupy the public consciousness in the twenty-first century, this module seeks to offer you a sense of the enduring qualities of the legends of the `once and future king'.

Identifying a series of critical concepts essential to the conceptualization  and production of early children's literature (among them easiness, gradation, and abridgment), we will consider how eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers have sought to convey challenging themes to young audiences as comprehensi bly, appealingly, and, at times, intensively as possible. How is the threat of child mortality treated in the New-England Primer's rhyming alphabet (1727) and Christina Rossetti's verse parable Goblin Market (1862)? How do Isaac Watts and George MacDonald respond differently to the challenge of introducing young readers to Christian theology? What taxonomic comparisons  might we locate between John Newbery's eighteenth-century compendiums and Victorian children's magazine? This course will also develop students' skills in using archival databases such as Eighteenth-Centurey Collections Online and Nineteenth-Century Collections Online.

In this course, we regard the `human' as (1) an evolving concept and (2) a lived experience.  As a concept, we trace the theoretical understanding of the human from humanism, transhumanism to posthumanism.  As a lived reality, we consider our place in the shifting relations between the human, the nonhuman and our environments. 

By close reading selected films, literary works and critical writings, we will explore encounters between the humanities and the sciences to rethink our relationship with our immediate reality. Our central question is: What does it mean to be human in the face of rapid technological advances, digitalization, climate change and the destruction of biodiversity?

You will develop a comprehensive understanding of the textual and theoretical issues raised in the course, and will develop appropriate analytical skills in the process. More specifically, this module teaches you the skills and vocabulary required to respond to an array of postmodern literary and filmic texts. You will learn how to analyze and evaluate a diverse range of literary forms and genres, relevance to the period. Special attention will be focused on the manner in which grand narratives are relativized and students will learn to independently assess various completing arguments, whilst developing your research skills. The course will also require you to engage with critical theorists of the period, including the work of key theorists such as Patricia Waugh, Brian McHale, Linda Hutcheon, and others.

This module looks at the ways in which `madness' is presented and interpreted in selected literature and films from the late 19th century onwards. Through close reading of literary and visual narratives, you will consider how representations of dissidence, deviance and madness are employed to critique aspects of society and challenge the audience member or reader's habitual framework of understanding. The module core material will be considered within the contexts of existing constructs of reality, such as the representation of gender, societal expectations and sexual transgressions.

Given that Introduction to Gender and Diversity is proposed as a module for a Minor programme,
it would take a broad, introductory approach to the critical  theory and its socio-political  and
historical contexts. The module will explore the intersectional constructions of gendered identity
according to a range of discourses that concern femininity, masculinity, transgendered identity, disability, ethnicity, class, nationality and virtual identities. It will consider the ways in which these discourses  underpin contemporary debates about diversity.   The  module encourages you to develop a broad  knowledge of the subjects studied and to hone your analytical  skills, with an appreciation of the conflicts and nuances inherent in discussions about diversity and gendered identities.  Furthermore, over the course of the module, you should develop articulacy and self-assurance in academic debate, both in class discussion and in written work.

Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The concept of business sustainability comprises three pillars: economic, environmental and social (Human &amp; Labor) - also known as people, planet and profits. (Investopedia https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp_). The focus recently (including by regulators) has added a fourth pillar - governance (anti-bribery and corruption). Organizations in the pursuit of profit have been implicated in a number of scandals involving bribery &amp; corruption, fraud, labour and human rights abuses, and environmental degradation. What role does law and ethics play in holding companies and individuals responsible for such scandals? How can companies ensure that they pay attention to social, environmental and governance factors and remain profitable? How do individuals and organizations decide what is the right thing to do? This course will require students to understand broad business sustainability issues and to apply ethical reasoning processes to decision making.

With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success.

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global. 

Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts.

This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. 

No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development of skills for dealing with complex problems in general.

The purpose of this course is to prepare you for the communication challenges that you are likely to meet in rapidly evolving global business environments. It will help you to present yourself confidently and professionally in the way you speak, write and participate in your chosen profession. 

AB0602 is designed to build on the communication theory, strategies and skills learnt in AB0601. Theory provides a conceptual framework that guides strategy and skills. Strategy allows communicators to make intelligent choices about content, organisation, style, tone, delivery, and timing of messages. Skills are needed to craft effective written documents, give constructive feedback, and create as well as deliver persuasive business presentations. 

In addition, this course also offers you the opportunity to acquire an understanding of the method of Principled Negotiation developed at the Harvard Negotiation Project. You will gain hands-on experience in negotiation through engagement in negotiation simulations.

This course introduces you to cutting-edge concepts, frameworks and practices that are current in social entrepreneurship, as well as critical issues in business ethics as a knowledge foundation for analysing and practicing social entrepreneurship. The course considers how social entrepreneurship plays out in organizations ranging from conventional companies seeking to adopt corporate social responsibility practices to double-bottom-line businesses and social enterprises.
The course specifies strategic and implementation tensions inherent in aligning business and
social/environmental values, and provides frameworks with which to analyse and resolve the tensions at play.This course trains you into a quasi-expert of social entrepreneurship by enabling them to apply frameworks to making tough decisions in real business contexts.
The course includes four modules: strategic corporate social responsibility (SCSR); double-bottom-line business (DBL), social enterprise (SE) and business ethics (BE). It begins by analysing and making decisions on the cases of conventional companies conducting social innovation initiatives through SCSR and DBL. We will then move to explore the cases of social enterprises. You will observe both the common and distinctive challenges facing conventional companies and social enterprises. The modules of SCSR, DBL and SE will be followed by an Entrepreneur Panel where social entrepreneurs introduce their initiatives and engage in a highly interactive conversation with students. The course will finish by taking a look at business ethics theories and issues that provide analytical depth and clarification to your understanding of social entrepreneurship.

Previously, BC2406 introduced core concepts of Business Analytics and the important models in used by businesses and governments. However, there are more complex situations that require more sophisticated Analytics solutions. BC2407 is the continuation of BC2406. The main objective of BC2407 is to introduce students to advanced Analytics techniques to extract more useful and deeper insights under more complex realistic situations. At the end of the course, students will see the strengths and weaknesses of standard models, and learn advanced techniques to overcome the weaknesses in various scenarios. This course builds upon open source R software (as learnt in BC2406), and introduced a commercial software SAS, commonly used in Banks, Pharmaceuticals, MNCs and some government agencies. Students will learn the differences between R and SAS in both the model development phrase and in the standard software outputs.

Supply chain analytics is a set of approaches utilized to efficiently integrate suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses and stores and to efficiently manage material, information and financial flows so that merchandise is produced and distributed at the right quantities, to the right locations, and at the right time, in order to maximize system-wide surplus or value. It plays an important role in today's global economy, because efficient supply chains not only make companies more profitable but also allow customers to receive better products at lower prices. For business and technology management students, it becomes critical to have a good understanding of supply chains and its vital role as a source of both performance improvement and business innovation.

In this era of big data, many companies and public organizations invest heavily in various flavors of analytics: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. Among them, prescriptive analytics goes beyond what happened (descriptive analytics), what will happen (predictive analytics), and provides insights into what to do to help companies and public organizations make better decisions.
This course aims to introduce students to the theory and applications of prescriptive analytics: how to go from data to optimal decision-making. It contains two principal components (1) Data-driven optimization theories and techniques and (2) Important business applications in finance, investment, and operations management.
Optimization theories such as linear optimization, discrete optimization, network optimization, quadratic optimization, stochastic optimization, and robust optimization will be covered in this course, with applications in portfolio selection, asset allocation, risk management, revenue management, pricing and hedging of options, asset/liability management, appointment scheduling, retail operations, inventory management, and assets repositioning in a sharing economy.
We will also place a specific focus on analyzing real data and solving optimization models using Python with commercial solver Gurobi*.

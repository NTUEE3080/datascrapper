Environmental issues have entered the centre of international politics and global governance in the recent two decades. This course is to introduce global environmental politics and governance (actors, institutions, mechanisms, norms and power dynamics) to students, and examine the topic by a typology of three categories: global common pool resource, transboundary environmental disputes, and local accumulative environmental change. The course encourages and mentors student?s independent research and critical thinking beyond readings and classroom discussion by assigning them into groups and conduct in-depth case studies, taking them to visit an environmental organization with global outreach and impact, and guiding them to incorporate first-hand observation into systemic learning. Via multiple learning sources and innovative teaching methods, the course aims at opening a compound, dynamic and interdisciplinary field to the students.

This course focuses on the evolution of Singapore in the regional and global contexts
since 1945. It will discuss various factors--institutional, cultural, socio-political and
international - that have shaped the trajectory of Singapore over the past seven
decades. The successful story of Singapore`s economic development will be
understood within the domestic multi-ethnic mosaic and complex regional relationships.
It is the interplay of these forces that underscores the emergence and challenges of a
cosmopolitan global city-state with an emerging national identity.

This course will provide a broad survey of the domestic politics of the Southeast Asian region. Nations studied will include Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. It will also examine the important factors that shape the political landscape of
Southeast Asia, paying particular attention to the historical conditions (colonialism, modernity, nationalism, war etc) which gave rise to the construction of Southeast Asia as a geo-political entity.

Urbanization continues apace into the 21st Century worldwide, centering cities and metropolitan regions as critical units of politics and policy-making in issues including immigration, housing and climate c'hange. As large, dense and diverse human habitats, urban politics and policy-making are influenced by the dynamic triadic relationship among society, economy and land. In cities, land use allocation and production of space interact with the needs of diverse populations, capital and municipal institutions to generate contested spatial claims among multiple stakeholders. The size of its diversity and concentration of diversity also make cities places of subcultures, varied institutions and fragmented interests. As gateways for new ideas and adoption of new cultures, cities are also sites of dynamic social and spatial change that function as multi-scalar hubs of interconnections among the neighborhood, city, metropolitan and national levels.   

By 2030, Asia will emerge as the region with the most cities and with more big cities than anywhere else in the world, according to United Nations (2018). It should be expected that the 'local turn' in politics and policy-making experienced in American and European cities over the last two decades will continue, and Asian cities will follow suit, albeit differently due to their different political regimes. 

The course aims are twofold: 

Firstly, the course offers knowledge about the particularities of the urban environment for politics about space/place and policy-making, and an ongoing tension between people-based and place-based policies. This course draws upon multi-disciplinary knowledge in urban planning, sociology, geography, public policy and public administration to inform our understanding of urban politics and policy-making - essentially interdisciplinary areas of knowledge creation. 

Secondly, the course seeks to equip you with a set of skills to research and analyze questions related to policies that govern the functions, problems and life of a city. During the course, you should expect to engage in using comparative lens to examine problems common in the urban realm in cities outside Singapore, in order to inform creative policy recommendations that are applicable to the problems facing Singapore as a city-state

This course provides a critical survey of key theories and issues in environmental sociology. Beginning with an overview of environmental problems in the contemporary world, we examine the social construction of nature and the development of environmentalism as a concept and a social movement. In particular, we analyze the challenges of sustainable development and the roles of the state, market, and civil society in responding to environmental issues. Specific issues such as climate change, food security, and renewable energy are studied from a sociological perspective. The course will also consider issues related to environmental inequality and environmental justice.

This is an introductory core module for the minor in Geography and Urban Planning. It is an introduction to the study of society and space. In addition to foundational themes in human geography, we will also cover some of the most pressing socio-spatial issues in our world today. These topics will draw out the wide-ranging local-global connections in the fields of social, cultural, urban, political and economic geography. We will draw upon case studies from Singapore and around the world to provide empirical contexts to the concepts discussed in lectures.  Through the interdisciplinary lens of human geography, these contextual examples will reflect the diverse place-based practices, processes, problems and possibilities of life in contemporary societies.

This course introduces you to classical and contemporary scholarship in the study of urban life and development as a basis upon which to understand the practice of urban design and policy. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experiences of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning/design as a discipline through fieldtrip/s and a design project workshop (aka 'studio' in the language of the profession). You will work in groups to respond to an issue of urban concern in Singapore, establish the extent of the intervention and design a socio-spatial solution.

This course examines themes, concepts, theories, and trends which define the study of international development from a critical geographical perspective. Students will gain an understanding of the historical and contemporary challenges of global inequality with reference to specific case studies. We shall be discussing what Development means by examining different development pathways and strategies throughout the global economy. While the course's main premise is economic development, we shall be reading more widely across the literature which strategically ties development to different scales -bodies, villages, cities, nations, across borders - to show that development is really not limited to the Global South but is vitally about (dis)connections and (im)mobilities in the global economy. This will also show that development is not disembodied but made up of and affects different people in very different ways. Case studies from around the world are used to provide empirical contexts to the theories we learn about international development practices, processes and problems.

Borders and bordering processes are a fundamental field of study within human geography and adjacent fields of social science. This course is designed for Geography and Urban Planning students to begin exploring the basic theoretical and empirical elements of borders in a variety of contexts. This will help you understand the workings of our world, undertake more advanced courses in this program, and prepare for future careers that involve bordering processes, such as design, planning, politics, policy, and tourism.

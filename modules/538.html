In this course you will explore the development of contemporary art across Southeast Asia from the 1970s to the present, contextualised within the region's complex socio-political history. Covering Singapore and countries beyond, visual forms of all media, including installation, performance, and video are examined to understand how artists from economically and politically diverse regional societies have produced pieces revealing transregionally-connected expressive approaches specific to Southeast Asia. Through artwork analysis, in tandem with critical reading of assigned texts, you will develop visual literacy of regional contemporary art (particularly its themes and audience-engaging methods), and access to the art historical debates that distinguish Southeast Asian contemporary art in the global contemporary art arena.

This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future research in Film Studies.

Purpose: Practical Ethics is a course intended to introduce the elements of ethical reasoning, and several principal concepts of core theories in the main branches of normative ethics. We ask the questions: What is its nature? And, how does it work? The case for its reality and its rationally binding objectivity will be defended, then the main branches of ethical theories outlined. These include utilitarianism, Kantian duty ethics and the ideas of the virtue and natural law ethical tradition stemming from Aristotle and Aquinas. A brief overview of theories of justice (including those of Rawls, Nozick and Sen) will be made. And it is intended that these concepts will be critically applied to the interface between ethics and law and the market, and some of paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, in a series of case studies under the headings: Profit, People, Planet. 

Intended Audience: It is a participation intensive course for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. These may include: corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and labour rights (people), and environmental sustainability (planet). 

Value: The course is intended to provide a breath of vision and understanding that will stand our students in good stead should they decide to pursue deeper studies in any particular area of ethics and as a basis for thinking their way around the concrete moral challenges of modern business and life.

This course will introduce students to the field of neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience. Neuromarketing involves capturing consumers' subconscious responses to brands, products and marketing materials in order to predict their purchasing behaviour more accurately than traditional market research methods (e.g. focus groups and surveys which are confounded by the fact that many times people either don't tell the truth about what they think or they don't know how they feel). The approach is now widely used by multinational companies to develop superior products that will also succeed in a global marketplace. The course will delve into the range of different neuromarketing techniques that are currently available (e.g. eyetracking while people use websites to see what they are attending to, monitoring brain activity while they viewing adverts or new product ideas to measure their emotions etc) and discuss the pros and cons of the different methods. Case studies will be used to demonstrate how the different approaches are being used by companies to tackle a very wide range of marketing questions. Students will also learn how insights from the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience can be applied in order to make marketing messages and communications more attention grabbing, more memorable and emotionally engaging. Also covered will be emerging research showing how digital technology is re-wiring the human brain and changing our behaviour in subtle ways but which marketers need to understand in order to create campaigns and messages that will be effective in today's digital environment. This course is vital for anyone who wants to understand consumers or customers at a deep, emotional level and to be able to market messages to consumers with greater precision.

Cultural intelligence (CQ) - the ability to deal effectively with people from different cultural backgrounds - is a critical attribute of global talent and leaders in the borderless world of the 21st century.
CQ is a proven scientific concept based on the science of intelligence. Research shows that CQ has a wide range of benefits for individuals, including:
1. More accurate cultural judgment and decision making
2. Better job performance
3. More effective global leadership
4. Win-win outcomes in intercultural negotiation
5. More creative ideas

Effective decision making is an essential skill everyone should have. Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions.

Drawing from a wide range of historical, literary and cultural texts that make 'animal' a common subject matter, this course's major aim is to offer students from all academic backgrounds and levels a broad and general overview of Chinese history, culture and society through the selected texts about animals in China.  
The course will explore the constructions of Chinese culture and society via a range of discourses such as Chinese philosophy and aesthetics; semiotics and representations; adaptations; gender, cultural and political identities; food culture; conservation and tourism studies; environmental and medical histories; as well as animal welfare and environmental humanities. These multidisciplinary approaches will develop your appreciation and critical reflection of Chinese art and culture from various perspectives.
Through the changing relationships between humans and animals, the course also highlights transformations of social and cultural values in recent decades, as reflected in the growing awareness of animal welfare, and social movements against animal injustice in contemporary China. As a result, you will learn the significant roles of animals in our society, as well as the interconnectedness between human beings and animals.

In the modern world, media occupy a significant portion of an average person's day. They also exert great power, swaying public opinion, changing people's values and teaching them all sorts of things, both good and bad. This course is intended to provide a critical evaluation of media by investigating the content of media messages, the characteristics of media consumers, and the mechanisms that underlie various types of media effects. 

It will introduce students to basic concepts in social science research and communication study, briefly review the history of media research, and examine some of the most common types of media effects. In its survey of media effects, the course will cover most prominent communication theories that help to explain the who, what, where, and why of media influence. 

The goal is for students to have deeper understanding of the extensiveness and limitations of media effects and to be able to critically assess claims of media impact.

The aim of this course is to offer a broad perspective to video games from motives to consequences, and from business models to various platforms of video games. Based on selected papers and book chapters, the course focuses on why people play video games, how players respond to them, what their effects and consequences are, and the popular platform of video games and their business models.

For this, a few popular video games will be selected for each week together with a relevant book chapter or article for students to identify the week?s topics and explain how such topics are applied in the selected video games. During the lecture, the instructor will provide a brief, historical, non-technical, conceptual introduction to the selected video games and their applications, suitable for students from any field. Then the class focuses on preparing students to participate in the global debates about issues related to video games such as violence, sexuality, addiction, education, and so on.

Every day, people make decisions based on information they receive through the media. Even when the information is accurate and complete, people can misinterpret it. Worse, the information might be inaccurate or incomplete. When people make decisions based on 'bad' information, the results can be far from ideal.

Media literacy is a competency to use media tools, both as a content creator and information consumer. The latter competency is important for society because it affects how people respond to ideas they encounter in the media. Misinformation, fake news, and rumours are examples of the kinds of 'bad' information people may receive. 

There are several questions pertinent to media literacy: How far does 'bad' information pervade the media? How media-literate is the average information consumer? What factors contribute to or hinder media literacy? Can media literacy be taught? This course provides some answers to these questions and addresses the broad question, what is the role of media literacy in society?

This course is meant for all students who have an interest in media, whether that interest aligns with career aspirations or personal curiosity. Although you may further develop your own media literacy skills through this course, this course is not about how you can become more media literate. It is about why people everywhere need media literacy. In other words, you may gain perspective on your own media use, but the focus of your learning will lead to new insights about media literacy and society.

This elective Communication course aims to explain how music communicates. By looking at music across history and social contexts, as well as what sorts of effects music has and why, you will develop a deeper appreciation of music. You can expect traditional (interactive) lectures, along with discussion sessions and activities, plus lots of multimedia - you'll hear (and see) the concepts in action. Communication majors and non-majors alike will find something interesting in this course; all that is required is that you enjoy or are curious about some sort of music! After completing this course, you will understand how music is used by others (and can be used by you) to communicate.

This course will provide an overview of the genre along the two paths - Diachronic approach and Synchronic approach. The first half of the semester will be devoted to the former while the second will be dedicated to the latter. During the second half we will touch on five issues (feminism, postmodernity, virtual reality, body, and artificial intelligence) that have repeatedly but variably appeared in many science fiction films from the genre's very beginnings to the present day. From Metropolis, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alien to Back To The Future and Ex Machina, this course will screen a diverse set of films followed by in-depth analysis and intensive discussions which foster the critical thinking for assessing and advancing arguments about the subject. Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to situate science fiction films in relation to their generic and historical lineage and to critically analyse them in terms of their cultural resonance and their aesthetic properties.

Through close reading of literary and visual narratives, you will consider how representations of dissidence, deviance and madness are employed to critique aspects of society and challenge the audience member or reader's habitual framework of understanding. The module core material will be considered within the contexts of existing constructs of reality, such as the representation of gender, societal expectations and sexual transgressions.

Given that Introduction to Gender and Diversity is proposed as a module for a Minor programme,
it would take a broad, introductory approach to the critical  theory and its socio-political  and
historical contexts. The module will explore the intersectional constructions of gendered identity
according to a range of discourses that concern femininity, masculinity, transgendered identity, disability, ethnicity, class, nationality and virtual identities. It will consider the ways in which these discourses  underpin contemporary debates about diversity.   The  module encourages you to develop a broad  knowledge of the subjects studied and to hone your analytical  skills, with an appreciation of the conflicts and nuances inherent in discussions about diversity and gendered identities.  Furthermore, over the course of the module, you should develop articulacy and self-assurance in academic debate, both in class discussion and in written work.

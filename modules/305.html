This course is intended for students interested in the meanings of being a Chinese overseas in a rapidly changing world. It investigates the changing relations Chinese overseas have with China and the factors underlying these changes. It first looks at Overseas Chinese's concern about China's political upheaval and social disorder before 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded. It then examines the isolation of Chinese overseas from China between 1949 and 1978, because of the radical political movements in China and nation-building projects in their countries of residence. It subsequently explores the responses of Chinese overseas after 1978 when China launched economic reform. This course provides you with the necessary knowledge for future courses in HC4060 and HC4061.

This course combines a variety of texts and gender/sexuality research theories in order to discuss issues of sex and gender/sexuality in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. These include sexual attractiveness and sexual desire in pre-Qin and Qin/Han literature, lust and eroticism in Ming/Qing literature, the destruction of family and the abandonment of marriage in early modern Chinese literature, love in friendship and the construction of masculinity, Chinese feminism and female sexual desire, new sexual morality discourse and the great debate on love, the first and second waves of feminism, and queer theory. By tracing the development and changes in Chinese concepts of gender/sexuality from ancient times to the present day, this course aims to ensure that you can, while remaining rooted in history, refer to constructions of knowledge in Western gender/sexuality culture and theory and proceed to rethink and deepen the contemporary discussion on these topics on an individual and societal level.

This course is an introduction to contemporary political philosophy. States claim to have a monopoly on the justified use of coercive force. This is a stunning, and perhaps alarming, claim. It's all the more stunning once we recognize that this power is wielded, not merely over non- human animals or children, but over competent adults. Accordingly, the fundamental question of contemporary political philosophy is this: How is authority - i.e., the power to create moral obligations in others by means of commands -possible among free and equal moral persons? Anarchists think this question does not admit of a plausible answer. In this class, we'll see if they're right.

In this course, you will learn about various theories of the moral justification of state power.  You will critically evaluate arguments for and against these theories. Finally, you will be trained to write essays in which you argue for your own views about whether and how states can be morally justified in wielding coercive force.

This course offers an overview of central arguments and debates in early modern philosophy. We will examine different responses to what is arguably the central epistemological question of the period: is knowledge based on reason or on experience? By working through the answers to this question given by Descartes, Hume, Leibniz, and Kant, we will better understand key commitments of the Rationalist and Empiricist philosophical traditions, and get a sense of how Kant attempts to transform the terms of the debate. We will also have the opportunity to cultivate analytical and critical skills that will help us better understand the arguments of early-modern philosophers and their relevance today. The course will feature extensive textual and argument analysis.

This course provides an introductory treatment of biomedical ethics - one of the most practically relevant areas of applied ethics.  It is suitable for any interested undergraduate; it will not be assumed that students have previously taken a course in ethics or philosophy. The course will be of use to anyone considering a career as a medical clinician or researcher, and to anyone who wishes to learn about the role of ethics in biomedical practice.

Attention will be paid to a range of topics in biomedical ethics. Each of these topics highlights the morally relevant features of biomedical policy and practice. We will examine the moral rights of patients and other stakeholders vis a vis physicians and medical care institutions at large. We will also cover moral questions raised by genetic and reproductive control: for instance, the genetic screening of human embyros and surrogate pregnancies. Termination of life issues will also discussed - e.g., abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide - as will ethical dilemmas raised by the distribution of medical resources like organs and health care.

The first part of the course will focus on major theories about the nature of science, including those of the logical empiricists, Karl Popper, and Thomas Kuhn. The second half of the course will examine a variety of topics within contemporary philosophy of science, which may include: social studies of science, science and values, the ethics of science, scientific realism, as well as the application of philosophy of science to problems in the science of well-being, climate science, and other fields.

This course offers an introduction to and overview of some of the most important philosophical currents of European philosophy in the 20th century. Its goal will be to help students understand the key claims, strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions of central areas of European thought, especially phenomenology, existentialism, critical theory, structuralism, continental feminism, psychoanalysis, hermeneutics, and deconstruction.

Through a combination of close reading and textual analysis, we will study how thinkers from different currents in European philosophy attempt to resolve the problems they think plague their predecessors, and how they propose to move beyond them.

Some topics and questions to be explored include the relation between perception, thought, and language; the philosophical importance of history; the limits of human reason and knowledge; what embodiment can tell us about experience; the role of ideology and power in the formation of human knowledge, etc.

Public policy is any institution, norm, or rule created by a government to guide people?s behavior. The study of public policy raises significant ethical questions. In particular: to what ends should citizens? behavior be guided, and by which means should a government guide such behavior? When might a public policy intervention by the government in the affairs of private individuals be unethical? Ethics and Public Policy will survey a number of areas in which public policy has been used to address social and political issues: crime, immigration, health, safety, inequality, religion, and the family. Students will question, debate, and reflect on the ethical principles which favor or disfavor the implementation of various public policies.

Epistemology is the philosophical study of knowledge and beliefs. Traditionally, epistemology has focused on the knowledge and beliefs gained by individuals. The reality, however, is that we gain much of our knowledge and beliefs in a social environment, rather than merely by ourselves. In this class, we will cover philosophical discussions on forming knowledge and beliefs based on the testimony of others, by comparing one's beliefs to one's peers, in group settings, and via other collective methods.

Logic underwent a revolution in the late 19th and early to middle 20th century. Starting with Peirce and Frege, mathematicians and philosophers developed logical systems that were much more powerful than the traditional logical systems inherited from thinkers such as Aristotle. It became clear that by using these new tools, it was possible to formalize large swaths of mathematics, and many mathematicians and philosophers started to think that it may even be possible to reduce mathematics to formal logic. However, in the wake of this optimism, a number of results were proven that demonstrated several fundamental limitations inherent in our best formal logical systems. This class introduces students to the major positive results - including the soundness and completeness theorems of first-order logic - and the major limitation results, in particular Godel's incompleteness theorems and Church's undecidability theorem. The philosophical implications of the results will be emphasized.

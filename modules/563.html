Emerging trends in an increasingly interconnected world demand a new breed of the workforce - one that is not only well-trained in a single domain area but that also appreciates the complexity of real-world challenges. This course aims to allow students from different domain disciplines apply their domain knowledge as well as design and systems thinking principles to identify and solve open-ended real-life problems collaboratively.  You will be given opportunities to freely explore, take risks, pivot ideas, implement and/or prototype them, and learn from 'failures'.  The end-goal of this course will be a (possibly novel) prototype designed and created by your team to solve the problem you identified.  To improve your communication and leadership skills, you will also be required to present the development of your project to the class periodically.

Energy devices for sustainable urban environment is an introduction to the sustainability concept, the basic operating principles and applications of various sustainable energy devices: from harvesting energy devices to energy storage. Some examples are photovoltaic devices used for solar energy conversion, thermoelectric devices for thermal energy harvesting, turbines for wind energy harvesting and electrochemical devices (super capacitors or batteries) for renewable energy storage. The course will also introduce current trends in the energy market as well as forecast for the future. 
Contents: Sustainability Concepts, Crystalline Solar Cells, Thin Film Solar Cells, Thermo-Energy Devices, Other renewable energy sources and devices, Supercapacitors, Batteries, Recent advances in energy device research, Smart Power Grid.

This course is one of the Deeper Experiential Engagement Projects (DEEP) series of GERs, and aims to make use of projects initiated from hobby/interest-based activities to develop your awareness of the practical relevance of electrical &amp; electronic engineering (EEE) principles beyond the classroom.  In particular, you will be addressing topics common to your hobbies and everyday living that has relations to EEE one way or another, e.g., new ideas relating to innovation and creativity that make use of EEE concepts. Engineering is about creation, innovation driven by ideas and imaginations. It is the unifying process of bringing ideas or concepts into reality. Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into something useful, either in the form of tangible products or better ways of addressing a specific problem or needs. Quite often, this results in value creation, which ultimately translates into cost saving or realizable monetary gains. Through hands-on team-based projects in various tracks, you will further learn how to creatively and experimentally approach a challenging theme related to your hobby/interest. This experiential learning project may take place in halls with Residential Education facilities, NTU Clubs and Society spaces, or any appropriate spaces provisioned by the Schools or Institutes for such work.  You will learn experimental approaches, how to manage time and resources, and consider how your newly acquired knowledge and skills can be used to benefit others.

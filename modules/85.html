The international dimension has become a common feature of business and trade. We have all heard phrases such as `globalization,' `multinational corporation,' and `cross-border transactions,' 
and this course will discuss these ideas in some detail. Yet, despite the appeal of international business, many companies find that the process is not at all easy. Whether in a broad sense, or in terms of the specific functions and activities of a firm, international business involves interaction between multiple players, in a dynamic and interconnected environment.
This elective course aims to provide you with a clear basis of the multi-level structure of the international business environment, as an interactive nexus of domestic and global contexts, shaped by institutions, businesses, and stakeholders. The course will address the various dimensions that shape the international business environment, as well as those factors that impact businesses themselves. You will be able to identify and understand issues that affect globalization and the international business environment. You should also be able to apply this understanding to design optimal responses to an international business environment created and impacted by these factors.
The course will develop your ability to analyse the countries you would like to do business in. It will help you to analyse and understand the macro and industry environment, develop an entry strategy, as well as an appropriate business model and business plan.
Students interested in the international business environment will find this course useful.

Leading and managing change is often cited as one of the top leadership priorities in organizations. Yet a significant number of organisations reported high failure rate in driving change initiatives. While employees are told that 'the only constant is change', they often do not get much positive experience when supporting organizational change efforts. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences. This is because change occurs at multiple levels, from individual's mindset change to group, and even organization. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation. Business leaders, together with their Human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations. The aim of this course is to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change.

The electronic communications environment and the internet challenges how businesses protect their informational assets. This course is designed to prepare the candidate to evaluate the strategies needed to face these challenges. This course also looks at the potential liability and the prevention of the misuse of information and the publication of detrimental information. The use of electronic communications and new media (such as social media, blogs, wikis, interactive web-pages and video sharing - where the users are now generating content) continues to challenge the how the law deals with brands - embodying reputation and copyright of works of art, multimedia, databases, music and authored works.

This course aims to provide students with a good grounding in Intellectual Property law and how far they can be used to protect the interest of electronic property. 

The other main focus is on the regulation of electronic information and communication - or new media. The knowledge-based economy is underpinned by laws which protect information assets and private information, shapes transactions and provides security for the various interests of parties to electronic transactions. This course is designed to give an appreciation of the relationship between law and technology as well as how businesses must work within the rules affecting the knowledge-based economy. The approaches to the subject will be both practical and critical.

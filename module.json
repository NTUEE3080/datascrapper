As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication.  While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts.

This time period is marked by developments that were both exciting and disturbing for artists: Heisenberg?s ?uncertainty principle?; Einstein?s theory of relativity (1913-6); WWI (1914-1918), which silenced the suffrage movement in England and resulted in historical, geographical, psychological, and cultural fragmentation; the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916); the world reinterpreted through Marx, Freud, Darwin and Nietzsche; an accelerated growth of capitalism and industry; and technological modernization through inventions like the telephone, phonograph, wireless, x-ray, cinema, automobile, and airplane, all of which changed our sense of time and space. These radical shifts often resulted in a sense of anxiety: a loss of faith in reliable narratives, language, and the role of the artist. Artists also, however, saw this change as opening new ways of representing the world, allowing them to create new systems of meaning through their artistic forms and aesthetics. Together, we will close read the literature of this period in order to begin to understand the preoccupations and formal innovations of the modernist writer."

        "description": "Through the interpretation and study of selected works of American literature and culture from 1945 to the present, we will consider the ways that writers respond to changes in the economic, political, and social conditions of the United States during the postmodern era. While some writers reassert long-standing themes such as the individual's quest for freedom defined against the constrictions of status-quo, domestic life (Kerouac, Ginsberg, Morrison, the Confessional Poets), others pose intellectual questions about language and meaning through metafictional innovation (Nabokov, Vonnegut, Barth) or confront national myths such as the American Dream (Dylan, Mamet) and the romance of the Western frontier (McCarthy). In an age where mass culture has replaced intellectual literacy, contemporary American authors ponder the place of the novelist in the world (DeLillo), reflect on the meaning of ethnic identity (Walker), and seek out a critical perspective from which to view the present"

It will offer an historical account of the emergence and development of these national literatures, while also focusing on some of the major social and political issues they address. Of particular interest will be the epochal impact of colonialism, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the disillusionment of Independence, and the numerous challenges faced by postcolonial African societies. We will also be discussing the significance of the oral tradition in African literature, and the controversy surrounding its use of English, the language of the colonizer. Although literature will be our primary focus, the module will include an analysis of the South African film Tsotsi, and will introduce students to a number of important theoretical concepts in the field of postcolonial studies."

In this module, we shall critically analyse the shifting,ambiguous, and yet creative, two-way relationship between film and literature. This course investigates the shifting, ambiguous, and creative two-way relationship between film and literature.

        "description": "Martin Esslin coined Theatre of the Absurd to group together a substantial number of post-World War II dramatic works that questioned realism and challenged the conventional dramatic form.' There was no Absurdist movement, and most playwrights whom we consider Absurdists did not identify themselves as such. Nevertheless, the designation is useful to begin thinking about their\tshared concern for what it means to be human in a time of social and political upheaval. You will be provoked to consider this central question as you learn more about the playwrights' dramatizations of habit, time, humour and suffering. The course will train you to close read Absurdist plays, and develop an appreciation for theirI destabilising effects on actors and the audience member. By the end of the course, you are expected to be able to differentiate between the social, historical,philosophical factors that affect the writing and production of absurdist drama. The seminar format will facilitate discussions as\t you share your reading, viewing, and performance/staging experiences with the class.  Course Content The discomfort and frustration evoked by the Theatre of the Absurd force character(s) and the audience to confront the question, \"What does it mean to be human?\" Each week, we will look\tclosely at one play, and if a recording of a production is available, we will view snippets in class to give you an idea of how each play could be staged. You will also perform scenes from the play in\t1, class. The course will provoke you to consider what it means to be human as we look closely at absurdist portrayals of habit, time, humour and suffering."

How widespread were the Arthurian legends across medieval Europe, and what made them so appealing to authors of English literature in more recent centuries? These are some of the questions to be explored on this module, which surveys the long development of several of the major narratives involving King Arthur and his knights, stretching from their medieval origins to modern literary adaptations. The first half of the module focusses on medieval texts, all of which will be studied in translation. You will gain an understanding of the generic, stylistic and thematic individuality of these medieval texts, as well as an awareness of the ways in which each text reflects the composer's explorations of the fundamental moral questions underpinning themes such as chivalric heroism and romantic love. The second half of the module turns towards modern reception, and here you will explore the changing significance and reimaginations of the Arthurian tradition in the nearer past. As Arthurian adaptations and reinventions continue to be produced and to occupy the public consciousness in the twenty-first century, this module seeks to offer you a sense of the enduring qualities of the legends of the `once and future king'."

Focussing primarily on verse, students will examine a rich range of texts labelled 'Romantic', reflecting on what it means to read, sound out, listen to, and critically interpret poetry of the period. The course combines close reading with contextual analysis, giving students the opportunity to develop their understanding of poetic forms and devices while exploring works in their aesthetic, cultural, and political milieu. It also draws together current research in the fields of Romantic studies and poetics with literary criticism published during the period, by writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Throughout the semester, students will consider how poems on the syllabus were experienced by Romantic audiences, using the William Blake Archive to access high-resolution reproductions of Blake's illuminated books and the Princeton Prosody Archive to access late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century guidelines for reading poetry aloud."

        "description": "This course explores how the meanings of words combine in often complex ways to give rise to the meanings of utterances. After developing a set of tools for characterising word meaning, it addresses the relationship between semantics and syntax, and to what extent each is necessary for characterising the grammar of a language. Since utterances are used to convey more than just literal content, and since context is essential for resolving the reference of pronouns and other ambiguous expressions, the course explores the possibility that semantics and pragmatics can be treated a single integrated framework for understanding communication. Prosody represents a parallel aspect of meaning and is explored in depth. Overall, students will learn to approach the notion of meaning from different viewpoints, and to carry out precise analysis that best fits with the phenomenon and language involved."

        "name": "THE MEAT OF SPEECH",
        "description": "The course begins broadly by summarizing basic topics in anatomical organization of the body, such as tissue types, and reviews core anatomical  terminology,  but then quickly narrows in on the main theme, which concerns how the body produces and perceives speech. Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.  The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.  The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/)  will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complex orchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to produce detailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  including those discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attention will also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.  The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.  The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.  The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.  Key subjects covered include: 1.\tusing  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  of speech production and perception; 2.\tthe relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanisms of speech production; 3.\tan  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function; 4.\tan appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing; 5.\tpractice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data."

It focuses on the medium itself and on the nature of the medium as it relates to both political and documentary subjects. The module therefore is designed to show and teach students the double aspects of film, firstly, to reflect reality and, secondly, to tackle political topics with highly contentious subjective techniques. While films are generally seen as a leisure activity, the cinema cannot be divorced from society and the pressing issues of our times. It can function as a forum in which viewers are not only entertained but informed and educated and cognitively prepared to develop good citizenship. The audience is presented with topics and issues of great concern in the community, which are often controversial, and certainly provocative. This module seeks to stimulate and inspire students towards a more critical view of cinema as a medium that challenges viewing practices and cognitive senses through the content of the films. Students will be taught to understand the cinema as a medium of social communication, presenting stories that question our views of society and politics.  The module will familiarize students with a range of cinematic works, key readings and important trends in contemporary global cinema and, secondly, to develop critical tools and skills in analyzing contemporary films with respect to both their aesthetic properties and their various historical, social, political determinants."

        "description": "From Samsung Galaxy Notes to Gangnam Style dances, since the late 1990s, Korean popular entertainment and products have been making substantial regional and international headways. Once a cultural backwater, the intensive export of South Korean products has changed the flow of the transnational circulation of popular media and culture not just East and Southeast Asia, but the larger world. Making up for its geo-political marginality is its newfound soft power status when countless households from Japan to Latin America are watching its television dramas and where teenagers from Singapore to Canada line up for Kpop auditions to be the next Korean popular music sensation.  Accompanying the Korean Wave, or Hallyu are the heightened popular and scholarly discussions of the attributes of this phenomenon. A combination factors have been put forward to explain the rise of the Korean Wave including the release in creative energies arising from political liberalization in the 1990s, technological advancement particular in the era of the digital and social media, and significant investment and sophisticated marketing. In this respect, as a course, the Korean Wave will offer a potentially multidisciplinary engagement with students, many who are already avid fans of Hallyu products and icons."

        "description": "In order to sell a product, one must tell a story: one that engages the customer on a deeply emotional level. This is vital to modern branding, defining your company ethos and building long-term customer relationships. This course concentrates on visual storytelling for cinema, television and multi-media.  Story depends on solid structuring and the ability to utilise storytelling to awaken the imagination of the buyer, but first and foremost it is about emotion: generating the right degree of emotion and aligning that to company and product branding for given visual media. We therefore need to understand psychology and have real insight into people, not just as a persuasive tool, but a genuine understanding of what people's deepest desires are and how your brand delivers that desire. Having understood the tones, attitudes and empathy generated by your product, we must then structure well. There are two concepts we need to understand to convey this: striking the note of simplicity to engage the emotions and secondly basing those stories on timeless myths and storytelling principles.  Having instilled all this, we must then question the nature of advertising as a metacognitive process for the designer of commercials. This provides perspectives on the story being told and why we are compelled to tell it well. By viewing advertising examples from cinema, television and multi-media and investigating the myths and principles that underpin their success, this course reaches deep into the creativity of the student to grow beyond outmoded forms of selling and embrace the future of visual sales-personship.  The course therefore generates competency in storytelling for practitioners and researchers in the field of effective advertising. Enrollment is suited to advertising students, advertising industry practitioners, journalists, communications students as well as film, television and transmedia practitioners."

Output includes, but is not limited to conceptual objects, user interactions, anthropomorphic interfaces, event/service situations, environmental installations, temporal experiments etc. Teaching in this studio course is by lecture, presentations, projects and assignments.  Conceptual Design Framework in the Creative Process: The course begins with an introduction on the importance of placing ideas into a context that is driven not just by its form and function as the design genesis but instead through a tangent that looks at the design process conceptually prior to the practice of design ? a pre-theoretical approach to design by looking at why and how the creative process operates. Content here will critically examine of the design process itself, looking at the methodology designers take for granted in their creative and production activity.  Design as Discourse/ Critical Design: You will be introduced to the practice of critical design and its variants - such as speculative design and discursive design, and how they serve as powerful tools for discourse about the design of the world. These `tools of design? are critiqued and explored through the use of language, imagery, fantasy, connotations, metaphors, semantics in the conception and development of students? projects.

Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards. In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid."

In fact, the existence of living beings in this planet depends on the ability of thousands of proteins to work together in a seamless fashion. Furthermore, our ability to comprehend our surroundings is heavily influenced by the activity of billions of neurons in our brain. Such complex systems can be represented as static or dynamic networks of many interacting components. These components are typically much simpler in terms of behavior or function than the overall system, implying that the additional complexity of the latter is an emergent network property. Network science is a new discipline that investigates the topology and dynamics of such complex networks, aiming to better understand the behavior, function and properties of the underlying systems. In this course, we will study algorithmic, computational, and statistical methods of network science, as well as its applications in solving real-world problems in communications, biology, sociology, and cyber security. The specific topics include network metrics, properties, and models, network querying and analytics, network dynamics, and distributed graph engines. Another pervasive goal of this course is to guide students into the future by presenting research that reveals the ?next big thing? in network science."

This course aims to provide a broad understanding of big data and current technologies in managing and processing them. Key topics covered in this course include general principles of designing big data systems, distributed storage of big data, programming models in big data, big data analytics techniques, key-value stores, and big data analytics. Upon completion of this course, you will learn to evaluate issues associated with big data management and business data analytics, learn how the data is stored in a distributed file system and how queries and analytics run in parallel."

The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include:  1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains?  2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now.  3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.  All these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

        "description": "Power is the defining feature of international politics and security. As such, international relations scholars focus on great power-led regional institutions, such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), for their research, because those institutions possess 'power' in shaping international politics. However, there are so many other regional political/security institutions in the world, which begs an important question: what kind of power do regional security institutions that are not led by great powers have? This seminar aims to understand material and non-material power of non-great power-led regional institutions possess in shaping international and regional politics. To this end, the seminar offers you the in-depth knowledge of non-great power-led regional security institutions in the world, ranging from Asia to the Middle East to Latin America to South America. More specifically, the seminar explores their institutional history, objectives, and functions, exploring the applicability of the existing theoretical frameworks in the IR field. This seminar is geared toward those who are interested in secondary powers in international politics and security institutions."

        "description": "A study of democracy cannot take place without analyzing political parties and elections. Political parties, in the West at least, have contributed enormously to the flourishing and stability of democracy. Parties link the state and society, take part in elections and contribute towards the structuring (and re-structuring) of political processes and institutions. Yet, the nature of political parties differ throughout time and space; similarly, the nature of elections differ throughout democracies - there is significant diversity in the way the electoral systems are structured, the legislations governing elections, the frequency of elections, the way campaigns are conducted, inter alia. As such, there is a need to understand the differing types of parties and elections, the impact that they have on society and political systems, who runs in elections, how voters make their choices, and the threats to our existing understandings of democracy and elections. This module studies the development of political parties and electoral systems, emphasizing the analytical component (how and why) in addition to the standard descriptive approach (what)."

        "description": "Qualitative research is an essential tool for deeper probing of diverse social phenomena and for designing effective public management strategies and policies. In the public administration and policy areas, narratives, case studies, observations, and more recently, focus groups have contributed insight and depth to our understanding of the structural, managerial, and environmental factors embedded in the public sector. Given this, you, as an independent researcher, need to understand the philosophy of qualitative, non-statistical social science research, focusing on how to design methods of qualitative research and how to conduct the analysis. The main objective of this course is not only to empower you to critically consume research through various forms of qualitative methods, but also to provide the fundamental skills for their own future rigorous research work (e.g., final year project). More specifically, while studying different qualitative inquiry approaches, you will be able to create a rationale for a qualitative inquiry that will be applicable to their research (or a hypothetical one) and to conduct qualitative research with data production (e.g., interviews, case studies, and observations). Lastly, you will be able to analyze and interpret their data using content or another discourse analytic technique. This course is organized along the following themes: (1) introduction of qualitative research, (2) research proposal outline, (3) developing and designing qualitative research, (4) observation studies, (5) interviews, (6) discourse and narrative research, (7) analysis of verbal data, (8) video data analysis, (9) case study, (10) content analysis, and (11) mixed methods."

Food is fundamentally essential to our physical existence, but it is also intensely cultural, with socially constructed behaviour and preferences that are change-resistant even in the presence of new knowledge, policies, and practices. How have different historical, social, economic, political, and institutional factors contributed to shaping national and international food policy outcomes? In this course, we begin with a heuristic analytical framework that enables you to study how interests, ideas, instruments, and institutions interact and affect the formation, development, and implementation of national and international food policy decisions. This course is organised around four themes: politics of food identity; globalisation or glocalisation; politics of food scandals; and international politics of food. By taking this course, you will learn how food is a powerful lens to understand contemporary politics and policies beyond consumption and nutrition."

Through reading the contributions of contemporary theorists such as Alain Badiou, Jacques Ranciere, William Connolly, Davide Panagia, Joshua Foa Dienstag, Michael Shapiro, and others, we will investigate such diverse topics as film's relation to democratic thinking, the connection between cinematic and political representation, the political economy of film production, and film's embodiment of thinking the event. In addition, we will also examine a select group of particular film genres - specifically the Western, the horror, and the film noir - in order to understand what particular insights they communicate about contemporary political life."

In the first half of the class, you will take part in a number of quick-fire experiments, to build up an experimental `tool kit' of techniques. We will review current evidence about the influence of different linguistic features on different domains of cognition and perception (e.g., categorization, spatial cognition, numerical cognition, colour perception, audition, and cross-modal perception). For each domain, we will investigate how the published literature relates to language in Singapore, and identify gaps in the existing literature. Interactions between language and the mind in extreme scenarios (e.g., language deprivation) will also be addressed. In the second half of the course, you will identify a research gap, formulate detailed a hypothesis, preregister a study, and conduct a data collection exercise for presentation in the class Symposium - a poster session held in the final week of term. The lab-based class provides an in-depth experience of the research cycle from identification of knowledge gaps to hypothesis formation, data collection and research presentation, with a focus on 21st century research skills such as power analysis & preregistration.

There will be discussions on emerging research that examines the implementation and outcomes of community mental health programmes and the controversies and challenges in-down-scaling psychological interventions to new settings where they are administered by professionals not traditionally trained in the specialization of psychology. Issues relating to the current state of mental health in Singapore and efforts to improve it will be touched on. Students will be encouraged to apply lessons learned to the Singapore context."

        "description": "Recent discoveries have overturned longstanding beliefs that the neurophysiology of the brain remains relatively fixed after childhood.  We will discuss new research that compares and contrasts both adult and child neural cognitive neuroplasticity.  For example, it is now known that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, and that areas of the brain formally devoted to one modality can be quickly recruited for processing a second modality when circumstances require. This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning.  We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints. In particular, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ?brain training? programs."

At the end of the course, students will be able to: 1) gain an understanding of the human and natural factors which led to the formation of large political, social, and cultural units in different areas in the world, 2) be able to differentiate superficial short-term processes of change from more profound but subtle evolutionary trajectories by isolating and comparing specific attributes found in case studies derived from different eras, 3) develop processes of reasoning which will enable them to distinguish between necessary and sufficient causal factors, and dependent versus independent  variables which fostered the growth of large-scale socio-cultural units with specific geographical correlates and boundaries or frontiers, and be able to explain why these variables differ when discussing the origins of political, technological, economic, or religious institutions and adaptations in various parts of the world, and 4) be able to identify and critique hypotheses and assumptions advanced by some basic works of scholarship dealing with topics on which the course focuses: for example,  what constitutes a common long-term evolutionary trend which can be compared  across different places and times, and what superficial differences mask or obscure common evolutionary processes between different societies or geographical regions?"

The course begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to elements, starting with agriculture (-land-) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals, particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at the end of the course."

        "description": "After the end of the Second World War, the British Empire shifted its imperialist policy due to increased economic costs to sustain its colonies and the loss of strategically important spots, such as India and Suez. The rise of the United States and the Soviet Union also led to changing balance of power. With the rise of nationalist sentiments in Asia and Africa, it became increasingly uneconomical and difficult for Britain to hold on to colonies, leading to decolonisations in the 1950s and 1960s. This module explores the political, economic, social and diplomatic factors behind the decline of the British Empire and whether the Empire was strong or weak post-1945. It also examines how patterns of decolonisation varied in British colonies in Asia and Africa. Decolonisation was executed through diverging means in different pace. For example, democratisations and decentralisations took place in Malaya and Kenya soon after the Second World War while democratic reforms were absent in Hong Kong. While British administration ceased in Singapore in 1963, Hong Kong remained a British colony until 1997. Lastly, the module investigates various means employed by the colonial governments to suppress dissidents and capture the `hearts and minds' of the locals during the transitional period, ranging from psychological tests conducted in the Malaya Emergency and secret opinion polling systems in Hong Kong, to `sanitary surveillance' in Singapore and repressive interrogation camps in Mau Mau Uprisings. In doing so, students will critically examine the relationships between the British Empire and its colonies, the Cold War and decolonisations, and culture and colonial statecrafts in Africa and Asia from 1945 to 1997."

        "description": "This module explores the diplomatic, political, social and economic history of British Hong Kong during the period from 1945 to 1997. It examines how development in China and decolonization of the British Empire influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony.  Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between colonial Hong Kong, Britain and China via six inter-locking themes: imperial diplomacy, diplomatic end game, social order and colonial state-building, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of Hong Kong during the colonial era, useful insights in China's development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired."

        "description": "This course is an introduction to contemporary political philosophy. States claim to have a monopoly on the justified use of coercive force. This is a stunning, and perhaps alarming, claim. It's all the more stunning once we recognize that this power is wielded, not merely over non- human animals or children, but over competent adults. Accordingly, the fundamental question of contemporary political philosophy is this: How is authority - i.e., the power to create moral obligations in others by means of commands -possible among free and equal moral persons? Anarchists think this question does not admit of a plausible answer. In this class, we'll see if they're right.  In this course, you will learn about various theories of the moral justification of state power.  You will critically evaluate arguments for and against these theories. Finally, you will be trained to write essays in which you argue for your own views about whether and how states can be morally justified in wielding coercive force."

We will examine different responses to what is arguably the central epistemological question of the period: is knowledge based on reason or on experience? By working through the answers to this question given by Descartes, Hume, Leibniz, and Kant, we will better understand key commitments of the Rationalist and Empiricist philosophical traditions, and get a sense of how Kant attempts to transform the terms of the debate. We will also have the opportunity to cultivate analytical and critical skills that will help us better understand the arguments of early-modern philosophers and their relevance today. The course will feature extensive textual and argument analysis."

The course will be of use to anyone considering a career as a medical clinician or researcher, and to anyone who wishes to learn about the role of ethics in biomedical practice.  Attention will be paid to a range of topics in biomedical ethics. Each of these topics highlights the morally relevant features of biomedical policy and practice. We will examine the moral rights of patients and other stakeholders vis a vis physicians and medical care institutions at large. We will also cover moral questions raised by genetic and reproductive control: for instance, the genetic screening of human embyros and surrogate pregnancies. Termination of life issues will also discussed - e.g., abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide - as will ethical dilemmas raised by the distribution of medical resources like organs and health care."

Starting with Peirce and Frege, mathematicians and philosophers developed logical systems that were much more powerful than the traditional logical systems inherited from thinkers such as Aristotle. It became clear that by using these new tools, it was possible to formalize large swaths of mathematics, and many mathematicians and philosophers started to think that it may even be possible to reduce mathematics to formal logic. However, in the wake of this optimism, a number of results were proven that demonstrated several fundamental limitations inherent in our best formal logical systems. This class introduces students to the major positive results - including the soundness and completeness theorems of first-order logic - and the major limitation results, in particular Godel's incompleteness theorems and Church's undecidability theorem. The philosophical implications of the results will be emphasized."

The study of each type of loading is complemented by a large number of examples designed to strengthen the students' understanding of the subject.  Topic 5 is devoted to the determination of shearing stresses in beams under transverse loadings. More advanced aspects of the design of beams, such as the determination of the principal stresses at the junction of the flange and web of a W-beam, are in Topic 6. The chapter also includes the determination of stresses under combined loadings that can now include the determination of the principal stresses, principal planes, and maximum shearing stress at a given point. The determination of the deflection of beams is discussed in Topic 7. The first part of the chapter is devoted to the integration method followed by the use of singularity functions.

        "description": "With the universal acceptance of the United Nations Brundtland Commission report, sustainability became a major challenge for business leaders and managers. Its deceptively simple core theme of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' is now central for organizational success.  Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporation, employees, community, government, non-government and others. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to global.  Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this, yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their missions and sustainable objectives, something that critics, including their important stakeholders, are quick to point out and often do so loudly to organizational detriment. Poorly conceived or absent organizational ethics are increasingly a key facet for these conflicts.  This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful organizational outcomes as undertaken in the Asian region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry, government and community application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts.  No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large-, medium- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts. Thus a higher-level intent of this course is the development of skills for dealing with complex problems in general."

It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.  The course is aimed at enabling students to learn in depth the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication (marcom) activities. The course provides students with relevant knowledge about how businesses interact or communicate with the market. In particular, because planning and executing marketing communication programs are typically the responsibilities of marketing executives, the course can help students to prepare for a job position that involves marketing communications. It can help them deepen their understanding of marketing - in particular, what marketing communications involve and how marketing communications enable an organisation to achieve its objectives.  The course is designed to foster your logical thinking and creativity regarding marketing communications. Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts essential to your understanding of marketing communication (marcom) practices (e.g., how they work and their applicability). Learning these theories and concepts is also important because they facilitate you to choose and justify your choice and design of marcom activities.  Instead of treating marcom as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities. The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing). The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and discusses how they can be integrated for achieving the marketer's objectives. While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances."

        "description": "Cyber physical systems are typically designed as a network of interacting elements with physical input and output, and are characterized by the interaction between the physical world (sensors, user inputs, actuators) and the cyber world (processing, decision making). Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards. In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid."

Students will hone their skills for critiquing research and learn the basics of designing, conducting and reporting on their own sociological investigations. The course will prepare students for the Graduation Project.  The course is divided into four sections. In the first, we address certain basic questions in sociological research: how do we think about the connections between theory and empirical data? What do sociologists study and how? What are the differences between qualitative and quantitative research? We will also tackle the many ethical and practical issues that come about in sociologists? generation and use of qualitative data.  In the second section of the semester, students learn more about two of the most important approaches in qualitative sociological research: participant observation (also known as ethnography) and in-depth interviews. You will read examples of these methods as well as learn the techniques for conducting such research.  Third, we will discuss how to organize and interpret data, and how to effectively use data in theory-building and in our writings. We will examine once again the connections between theory and evidence, and thereby further discuss what makes for good sociological questions and how to design good research to address issues that sociologists and the general public care about.  Finally, we will briefly discuss textual and content analyses. We will also learn how to craft effective research proposals"

        "description": "Leading and managing change is often cited as one of the top leadership priorities in organizations. Yet a significant number of organisations reported high failure rate in driving change initiatives. While employees are told that 'the only constant is change', they often do not get much positive experience when supporting organizational change efforts. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences. This is because change occurs at multiple levels, from individual's mindset change to group, and even organization. Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation. Business leaders, together with their Human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations. The aim of this course is to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change."

        "description": "As a sports coach helps an athlete develop and excel at a sport, a health coach helps a person or team to excel at living healthy life to the full, taking the best. This course will equip you with foundations of health coaching - skills useful for life wherever it takes you - whether you will be the next CEO, a full-time dad or mom, an entrepreneur or a cool government employee. It comprises a series of modules covering highly engaging topics on health coaching with a focus on sleep as a superpower. This is the first course in a stackable learning series that would equip you ultimately as a super health coach. The course consists of 13 three-hour sessions (two sessions of 3 hours per week) comprising of blended and highly interactive learning activities, conducted in the first six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22. The last session will be an assessment session held in the sixth week. In addition, this same course will also be run in the last six weeks of Semester 1 AY2021-22, and an assessment session to be held in the sixth week. These sessions will cover the following seven themes: 1.\tBeing cool! Being super-woman and -man (introduction to health coaching) 2.\tWho cares about sleep? Superpower. (sleep) 3.\tThis is so tasty! (nutrition) 4.\tSweat the good stuff (exercise) 5.\tWhy? Why? It's driving me crazy! (mental wellbeing) 6.\tIs it gonna harm me? (addictions) 7.\tRelationships matter! (healthy relationships) The modules cover the topic of sleep, but also important areas that affect sleep such as nutrition, exercise, mental wellbeing, addictions, and healthy relationships. These modules will be offered in a `flipped classroom model' where students self-study materials and subsequently have discussions and practical interactive sessions. The students will practice coaching skills which will be assessed in a role-based assessment with simulated roles. The cutting-edge role of digital health supporting the coach and the person will be interwoven in every module. Finally, we Singaporeans are one of the most sleep deprived people. Some might even be proud about regularly not sleeping enough. However, this comes at a high price for wellbeing and health. Utilizing the superpower of sleep has a wide range of proven health benefits including a lower chance of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, and not least making one feel better! Recognizing that one can be cool whilst living healthy and shunning away from unhealthy lifestyle habits and applying early preventive measures to improve health is possible and is focus of this course. An important strategy to facilitate healthy lifestyle choices and promote health is through health coaching. Health coaching has been applied and shown to be effective in the prevention and management of chronic diseases and supporting lifestyle choices in healthy individuals. It is crucial to equip students with healthy lifestyle skills and knowledge and, specifically, on coaching techniques to create awareness about the importance of lifestyle choices. It will allow students to be equipped with essential skills to become health coaches and to take the role of health ambassadors later in their life. Moreover, health coaching can provide new career opportunities, with employment in healthcare expected to increase enormously in the coming years. This course will be the first in a series of courses on health coaching, with the current course having a focus on sleep. Sleep is crucial for health and wellbeing, and it is known that many students do not get enough sleep However, sleep deprivation is linked to lower cognitive and academic performance, lower productivity, obesity, depression, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, and numerous other health risk factors. Exercise, nutrition, and mental wellbeing all have an important influence on a healthy sleep pattern. A `stackable learning approach' is planned in which students will be able to `stack' certificates that will eventually lead to a professional diploma as health coach."

The learning environment has been espoused as the `third educator', a concept which is strongly rooted in early childhood education. Participants will gain insights into how the learning environments can provide stimulating and engaging activities that promote quality learning for the children across all learning domains.  In order to be equipped with the essential knowledge and skills to design effective environments, they will learn how to consider the needs of diverse children (individual and group), the relevance of the learning contexts, the use of age-appropriate and open-ended resources, issues of safety (physical and psychological), and the interlocking roles of the teacher as the environmental designer and as the facilitator of the learning in the setting up of the environment. To highlight the importance of exploration and play-based learning, and authentic experiences for preschool or lower primary children, the employment of learning centres will be extensively explored as an important pedagogical approach for teachers in the preschool or lower primary specialization. A key idea here is that the learning environment can support children as the protagonists of their construction of knowledge and foster respectful relationships. The course will therefore provide participants with an understanding of the principles and roles of learning centers and how these can be thoughtfully integrated within the preschool or lower primary curriculum and class setups (indoor and outdoor). The course will have a strong practical orientation. There will be opportunities for participants to link theory to practice through hands-on activities and assignments.

        "description": "Urbanization continues apace into the 21st Century worldwide, centering cities and metropolitan regions as critical units of politics and policy-making in issues including immigration, housing and climate c'hange. As large, dense and diverse human habitats, urban politics and policy-making are influenced by the dynamic triadic relationship among society, economy and land. In cities, land use allocation and production of space interact with the needs of diverse populations, capital and municipal institutions to generate contested spatial claims among multiple stakeholders. The size of its diversity and concentration of diversity also make cities places of subcultures, varied institutions and fragmented interests. As gateways for new ideas and adoption of new cultures, cities are also sites of dynamic social and spatial change that function as multi-scalar hubs of interconnections among the neighborhood, city, metropolitan and national levels.  By 2030, Asia will emerge as the region with the most cities and with more big cities than anywhere else in the world, according to United Nations (2018). It should be expected that the 'local turn' in politics and policy-making experienced in American and European cities over the last two decades will continue, and Asian cities will follow suit, albeit differently due to their different political regimes.  The course aims are twofold:  Firstly, the course offers knowledge about the particularities of the urban environment for politics about space/place and policy-making, and an ongoing tension between people-based and place-based policies. This course draws upon multi-disciplinary knowledge in urban planning, sociology, geography, public policy and public administration to inform our understanding of urban politics and policy-making - essentially interdisciplinary areas of knowledge creation.  Secondly, the course seeks to equip you with a set of skills to research and analyze questions related to policies that govern the functions, problems and life of a city. During the course, you should expect to engage in using comparative lens to examine problems common in the urban realm in cities outside Singapore, in order to inform creative policy recommendations that are applicable to the problems facing Singapore as a city-state"

While the course's main premise is economic development, we shall be reading more widely across the literature which strategically ties development to different scales -bodies, villages, cities, nations, across borders - to show that development is really not limited to the Global South but is vitally about (dis)connections and (im)mobilities in the global economy. This will also show that development is not disembodied but made up of and affects different people in very different ways. Case studies from around the world are used to provide empirical contexts to the theories we learn about international development practices, processes and problems."

We ask the questions: What is its nature? And, how does it work? The case for its reality and its rationally binding objectivity will be defended, then the main branches of ethical theories outlined. These include utilitarianism, Kantian duty ethics and the ideas of the virtue and natural law ethical tradition stemming from Aristotle and Aquinas. A brief overview of theories of justice (including those of Rawls, Nozick and Sen) will be made. And it is intended that these concepts will be critically applied to the interface between ethics and law and the market, and some of paradigmatic issues and situations in three areas which confront businesses and people in all fields of practical endeavour today, in a series of case studies under the headings: Profit, People, Planet.  Intended Audience: It is a participation intensive course for students who welcome informed critical discussion based on required readings of extracts from the primary writings of the philosophers under study. These may include: corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (profit), employment equality and labour rights (people), and environmental sustainability (planet).  Value: The course is intended to provide a breath of vision and understanding that will stand our students in good stead should they decide to pursue deeper studies in any particular area of ethics and as a basis for thinking their way around the concrete moral challenges of modern business and life."

        "name": "CONSUMER NEUROSCIENCE: HOW BRAIN SCIENCE IS INFORMING BUS",
        "description": "This course will introduce students to the field of neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience. Neuromarketing involves capturing consumers' subconscious responses to brands, products and marketing materials in order to predict their purchasing behaviour more accurately than traditional market research methods (e.g. focus groups and surveys which are confounded by the fact that many times people either don't tell the truth about what they think or they don't know how they feel). The approach is now widely used by multinational companies to develop superior products that will also succeed in a global marketplace. The course will delve into the range of different neuromarketing techniques that are currently available (e.g. eyetracking while people use websites to see what they are attending to, monitoring brain activity while they viewing adverts or new product ideas to measure their emotions etc) and discuss the pros and cons of the different methods. Case studies will be used to demonstrate how the different approaches are being used by companies to tackle a very wide range of marketing questions. Students will also learn how insights from the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience can be applied in order to make marketing messages and communications more attention grabbing, more memorable and emotionally engaging. Also covered will be emerging research showing how digital technology is re-wiring the human brain and changing our behaviour in subtle ways but which marketers need to understand in order to create campaigns and messages that will be effective in today's digital environment. This course is vital for anyone who wants to understand consumers or customers at a deep, emotional level and to be able to market messages to consumers with greater precision."

        "description": "Effective decision making is an essential skill everyone should have. Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions."

        "description": "Every day, people make decisions based on information they receive through the media. Even when the information is accurate and complete, people can misinterpret it. Worse, the information might be inaccurate or incomplete. When people make decisions based on 'bad' information, the results can be far from ideal.  Media literacy is a competency to use media tools, both as a content creator and information consumer. The latter competency is important for society because it affects how people respond to ideas they encounter in the media. Misinformation, fake news, and rumours are examples of the kinds of 'bad' information people may receive.  There are several questions pertinent to media literacy: How far does 'bad' information pervade the media? How media-literate is the average information consumer? What factors contribute to or hinder media literacy? Can media literacy be taught? This course provides some answers to these questions and addresses the broad question, what is the role of media literacy in society?  This course is meant for all students who have an interest in media, whether that interest aligns with career aspirations or personal curiosity. Although you may further develop your own media literacy skills through this course, this course is not about how you can become more media literate. It is about why people everywhere need media literacy. In other words, you may gain perspective on your own media use, but the focus of your learning will lead to new insights about media literacy and society."

Writings in the humanities contain abstract concepts that often turn into scientific and technological reality. It is important for you as a scholar to learn how concepts in STEM disciplines have roots that go back to the humanities. It is also relevant for you to understand how scientific and engineering innovations have objectives that promote the quality of life for all members of our human race. You will learn to identify different methodologies and approaches to texts and discuss the rhetoric and reasoning employed in these texts. You will then apply these approaches to the real world of scientific and engineering technologies and events.  The second aim is to support your communication and presentation of scientific and technical concepts to the lay public. You will learn to explain technical terms in STEM fields in language that the non-scientific public can understand. You will learn to write and present persuasively, so that the lay public will be convinced of the scientific findings and results. This is important for you as a STEM scholar, as you will be facing policy makers and politicians in your career, and you should acquire the skills and techniques of persuasion and rhetoric."

Through team-based exploration of sustainability issues viewed from an interdisciplinary lens, students will gain knowledge about the process of research, including its fieldwork and documentation, and apply such knowledge in the field. They will learn how to gather and document empirical data ethically, and explain the rationale for the decisions they make as well as evaluate the success and limitations of fieldwork that centers around sustainability issues including, but not limited to, environmental sustainability (e.g., waste, pollution, energy), sociocultural sustainability (e.g., preservation and sustainability of national, regional, ethnic, racial, or other ingroup-based tangible and intangible culture and heritage), and economic sustainability (e.g., the promotion of long-term economic growth through efficient and responsible resource management).  The course is project-based, and students work in teams to go through the process of crafting their own subject matter, documenting, writing and storytelling using mixed media. This course contributes to the development of students in the NTU-University Scholars Programme in their competence as researchers with empathy, intercultural communication skills, and creativity.
